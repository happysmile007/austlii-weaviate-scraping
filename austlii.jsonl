AustLII is a joint facility of the UTS and UNSW Faculties of Law. AustLII relies on the generosity of its contributors to operate. To make a tax deductible contribution please use our [contribution form](/austlii/contributors/contribute.pdf).\n\n\nWhat does AustLII do?\n---------------------\n\n\nThe [Australasian Legal Information Institute](/) (AustLII) provides free internet access to Australasian legal materials. AustLII's broad public policy agenda is to **improve access to justice** through better access to information. To that end, we have become one of the largest sources of legal materials on the net, with over four million searchable documents.\n\n\nAustLII publishes **public legal information** -- that is, primary legal materials (legislation, treaties and decisions of courts and tribunals); and secondary legal materials created by public bodies for purposes of public access (law reform and royal commission reports for example) and a substantial collection of law journals.\n\n\nLegal Information on AustLII\n----------------------------\n\n\nAustLII maintains its own collections of [primary materials](/databases.html): legislation and court judgments (\"case law\"). Some legal training or familiarity with the subject matter is sometimes required to make use of these documents.\n\n\nAlternatively, AustLII also has a collection of [secondary materials](/databases.html#other): commentaries and summaries on the law. This includes large projects such as the [Australiasian Law Reform Library](/au/special/lawreform/), the [Australasian Law Journals Library](/au/journals/) and many others.\n\n\nHelp on using AustLII is available.

{"url": "https://www.austlii.edu.au/copyright.html", "title": "AustLII Usage Policy", "content": "\nPolicy on use of documents located on AustLII ('AustLII Usage Policy')\n======================================================================\n\n\n1. General principles\n---------------------\n\n\n(a) AustLII is a not-for-profit publisher that provides free (ie non-charged) access to individual end-users of the content it provides, to enable them to read, print and copy materials for their personal use, and any other uses permitted by copyright law.\n\n\n(b) In order to provide this service, AustLII has built a collection of primary and secondary legal materials (including cases, legislation, treaties, journal articles and law reform documents) by agreements with the various sources of the documents and rights-holders in the documents, and by other means such as scanning documents where documents are out of copyright or with the permission of copyright holders.\n\n\n(c) AustLII is not a data repository, in that it does not provide a service for other publishers to obtain documents from AustLII for republication. Other publishers need to obtain those documents from their original sources or by other appropriate and authorised means.\n\n\n(d) In relation to all documents that it republishes, AustLII does not give permission for the value-added content that it adds to documents (including hypertext mark-up, and alternative citations) to be republished by others. This does not include any restriction on the use of neutral citations used by AustLII, whether or not developed by AustLII.\n\n\n(e) AustLII places particular restrictions upon the ways in which case-law documents on AustLII can be copied and used. AustLII specifically blocks all spiders and other automated agents from accessing its case-law via the Robots Exclusion Standard. AustLII’s policy is the same as nearly all similar organisations internationally. The reasons for this policy include:\n\n\n* the need to balance personal privacy against open access, particularly in relation to general purpose search engines;\n* the need to allow compliance with take-down, anonymisation and other modification requests from courts and parties; and\n* the need to comply with licence conditions under which data has been provided to AustLII.\n\n\n2. End Use\n----------\n\n\n(a) Individual end-users of the AustLII system are free to access, copy and print materials for their own use in accordance with copyright law;\n\n\n(b) In relation to case law, this is subject to (1)(e) above.\n\n\n3. Copyright in content on AustLII\n----------------------------------\n\n\n(a) AustLII is not the copyright owner in the source documents published on AustLII and is not able to give permission for reproduction of those source documents.\n\n\n(b) AustLII claims copyright in all value-added content that it adds to source documents (including hypertext mark-up, and alternative citations). On request, AustLII usually gives permission for reproduction of examples of this content for teaching, training or similar purposes.\n\n\n4. Reuse of AustLII data by other commercial and non-commercial systems\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n(a) AustLII will not act as a data repository or re-supplier of source documents that it has obtained from their original sources, to other publishers for republication. This applies to both active re-supply of documents, or passive re-supply via spidering or other automated collection. Where spidering or other automated collection for these purposes is apparent, it will be blocked.\n\n\n(b) AustLII does in some cases negotiate agreements with other publishers for them to frame AustLII pages as part of their services, including assisting them to identify the correct pages on AustLII to which to link.\n\n\n5. Provision of source documents by Courts and other data providers\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n(a) AustLII supports Courts and other providers of public legal information in supplying the source data for which they are responsible (cases, legislation etc) on the same basis to all publishers, both in relation to (i) ongoing supply, and (ii) maintenance of archival copies of data previously supplied.\n\n\n(b) AustLII will assist Courts or other providers of public legal information in relation to(a)(ii) above if such assistance is requested.\n\n\n(c) Each Court or other provider of public legal information sets its own policies in relation to such matters as privacy (including access by third party search engines), ‘take down’ or replacement of decisions and republication of data by third parties including copyright policies.\n\n\n(d) AustLII complies with the policies of each Court or other provider of public legal information, and supports efforts to develop standards concerning such policies.\n\n\nThis policy may be amended at AustLII’s discretion.\n\n\n"}
{"url": "https://www.austlii.edu.au/privacy.html", "title": "Privacy Policy", "content": "\nPrivacy Policy\n==============\n\n\nAustLII’s privacy policies are based on respect for international standards of information privacy protection and are in accordance with Australian privacy laws including the New South Wales Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 insofar as it is applicable to AustLII.\n\n\nAustLII is a joint facility of the University of Technology, Sydney and the University of New South Wales. Information about individuals provided to AustLII staff in that capacity is provided to both Universities. The general web site privacy policies of our Universities may be found in the UTS Privacy Statement and UNSW Privacy Statement . AustLII’s privacy policies are consistent with those of our Universities, and the UTS and UNSW Privacy Statements should be read in conjunction with this Privacy Policy. This document sets out privacy policies particular to the operation of the AustLII website.\n\n\nAustLII collects information about individuals for the purpose of operating the AustLII free access web site (www.austlii.edu.au) and also to operate the WorldLII free access website (www.worldlii.org), and for directly related purposes including educational purposes arising from AustLII’s role as part of two Universities. References to ‘AustLII’ in this document also apply to the WorldLII website.\n\n\nAustLII collects two main categories of information about individuals, further details of which are set out below: \n\\* A. Information concerning usage of AustLII \n\\* B. Information about individuals contained in AustLII databases\n\n\nA. Information concerning usage of AustLII\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nA1. AustLII collects information which identifies, for each page accessed on AustLII, the network identity of the machine which has accessed it. AustLII retains this usage information for purposes of network analysis, usage analysis, and research into usage patterns for the purpose of improving AustLII services. Access to and use of this information is restricted to AustLII management and staff, and to researchers working on AustLII projects and subject to an agreement to adhere to this Privacy Policy.\n\n\nA2. AustLII does not disclose or publish information which identifies individual machines,or potentially identifying sub-groupings of addresses, unless we obtain consent or otherwise in accordance with legal requirements. AustLII does publish aggregated information about usage patterns.\n\n\nA3. AustLII may also gather more extensive information that stated above (i) about any attempted access to AustLII which raise security issues (and, where necessary, to make disclosures to relevant authorities); and (ii) for network analyses on an occasional basis. AustLII may also collect and use more extensive information about individuals in the circumstances set out under ‘Exceptions to the Rule’ in the UNSW Privacy Statement .\n\n\nA4. If you contact AustLII via email (at our Feedback address or otherwise) we will only use your email address and any information about individuals you provide to us for the purposes for which the information is provided. It will not be added to a mailing list without your consent.\n\n\nA5. Cookies are not used by AustLII to collect information.\n\n\nB. Information about individuals contained in AustLII databases\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nB1. Some AustLII databases contain information about individuals, including the decisions of Courts and Tribunals, and the reports of Royal Commissions. AustLII publishes these databases with the consent of the public bodies concerned. It is the responsibility of the public bodies which provide these databases to AustLII to determine, subject to the requirements of the laws under which they operate, the appropriate balance between the privacy interests of individuals and the public interests in dissemination of the information. In particular, if information about individuals is to be anonymised before publication, or after publication due to factors such as spent convictions legislation, this is done by the public body concerned. AustLII complies with applicable legal restrictions on publication, but does not and can not censor part or all of the information provided by these public bodies for publication.\n\n\nB2. AustLII does not give a general consent to the contents of these databases being indexed by other web sites. AustLII attempts to prevent such indexing occurring by placing these database outside the permitted scope of web ‘crawlers’, ‘robots’ or ‘spiders’ that adhere to the voluntary Robot Exclusion Standard. AustLII makes an exception to this general rule in some cases to allow other law web sites to index selected AustLII databases.\n\n\nAustLII also monitors whether any robots attempt to index these databases in disregard of this Standard, and takes steps to exclude any that do so from any access to AustLII.\n\n\nB3. AustLII users should note that there are legal limitations on the use, publication and dissemination of some information about individuals contained in AustLII databases, either relating specifically to certain databases (eg section 121 of the Family Law Act 1975) or relating to material found in any databases (eg Commonwealth and State laws concerning juvenile offenders or sexual offences). There is also legislation in most Australian jurisdictions providing limited protection against the disclosure of old convictions (often after a period of ten years) provided that the person concerned has not been re-convicted within that period (‘spent convictions’).\n\n\nB4. Other legal publishers (both online and in print, free access and commercial) publish the same cases as are included on AustLII. If any person considers that any case in an AustLII database may contain information which it should not include, AustLII suggests that they should contact the Registrar of the Court or Tribunal concerned, setting out the reasons why there is information in a case which should not be published. The Court or Tribunal is then in a position to inform all previous recipients of the case of any matters that need to be changed.\n\n\nB5. If a person informs AustLII (or AustLII becomes aware from any other source) that any case (or other document) in an AustLII database may contain information which it should not include, AustLII adopts the following procedure:\n\n\nAustLII will bring the matter to the attention of the Court or Tribunal (or other body) concerned and will obtain its advice concerning whether the case is to be removed, is to be replaced by an alternative version of the case (including an anonymised version in some situations), or is to remain as it currently stands.\n\n\nIn all instances to date, AustLII has followed the advice provided by the Court or Tribunal.\n\n\nC. Contact and other information\n--------------------------------\n\n\nAustLII may be contacted at this address: Australasian Legal Information Insitute, c/- Faculty of Law, University of Technology, Sydney, Box 123 Broadway NSW 2007.\nIf you wish to contact AustLII concerning this policy you are also welcome to send email to our Feedback address [feedback@austlii.edu.au](mailto:feedback@austlii.edu.au).\n\n\nDue to the developing nature of privacy principles for online communication, this policy may be modified or expanded in light of new developments or issues that may arise from time to time. The amended policy will be posted to this site and will operate from the time it is posted.\n\n\n"}

AustLII - The Organisation](#q7)\n\n\n\n\n[1](#q1) Content, Databases and Markup\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n### [1.1](#q1.1) I have found a wrong (or acontextual) link!\n\n\nThis is the product of the massively automated \"markup\" software used by AustLII to insert hypertext links. The software is essentially heuristic in nature - that is, it makes 'intelligent guesses' and therefore also makes the occasional mistake, such as a link to the section of an incorrect Act where the context of the case does not make it clear which Act is referred to. Many of these mistakes relate to the nature of the English (and particularly legal) language. We continue to improve the heuristics used by the markup software.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.2](#q1.2) I have found a broken link!\n\n\nBroken links (ie links which produce a file not found message) can usually be fixed and should be reported to AustLII Feedback, with details of the URL of the page where the link is located and what you expected to find.\n\n\nNote that we cannot fix broken links which are not located on our web site.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.3](#q1.3) How do you do the hypertext markup?\n\n\nThe software to mark up AustLII's databases is the result of a number of years of development. The heuristic rules that it embodies continue to be refined to deal with the nuances of the various databases available via AustLII.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.4](#q1.4) Why is the alphabetic list of cases wrong?\n\n\nThe alphabetic list of cases which is available from the opening pages of some databases is generated automatically from the cases in the database. Unfortunately this may mean that the list of cases is not as useful as it might be, since case names provided by courts and tribunals can include first names and other details.\n\n\nIf you do not find a particular case name by browsing the alphabetic list:\n\n\n* use the [Case Name Search] facility from the Case Database Index page; or\n* use the Search AustLII page, choose the \"this case name\" find option, and select the relevant case database(s) to search.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.5](#q1.5) How do I find the XYZ Act or Regulation?\n\n\n* **Using Autosearch:** The simplest way to find an Act or a section an Act is to just type the name and or section reference into the search box on the AustLII opening page. Austsearch will detect this and will diplay a list of matching legislation from all jurisdictions.\n* **Browsing:** If you know the jurisdiction (ie Commnwealth, NSW etc) name of the Act or Regulation for which you are looking, the best approach may be to browse for it by clicking on the relevant jurisdiction from the AustLII Databases page, choosing the appropriate act or regulation database, and then selecting from the alphabetical list.\n* **Searching:** If you do not know the jurisdiction (ie Commonwealth, NSW etc), but know the name of the Act or Regulation for which you are looking, go to the Search AustLII page, set your find type to this legislation name and select \"All Legislation Databases\" for the databases to search. If you do know the name of the jurisdiction, then select the appropriate database (eg \"NSW: All Legislation\").\n\n\n\n\n### [1.6](#q1.6) How up to date is the XYZ database?\n\n\nThe simplest way to check database currency is via the \"Update Status\" links on the front page.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.7](#q1.7) Does AustLII publish an authorised version of XYZ?\n\n\nThe reproduction of legal materials on AustLII is always with copyright and data permissions of the Courts or Legislatures. However, this permission should not be read as having granted 'authorised' status to the AustLII published version.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.8](#q1.8) When will materials from XYZ be added to AustLII?\n\n\nWe are always negotiating for the addition of new materials to the AustLII databases. There is a recognised advantage in the use of comprehensive sources when undertaking legal research, and we aim to make AustLII the most comprehensive resource for Australian legal research.\n\n\nIf you work for a court or tribunal that does not have its materials published on AustLII then we encourage you to contact us at AustLII Feedback to discuss arrangements. If you'd like to see a particular court or tribunal on AustLII then contact the court or tribunal and suggest to them that they publish on AustLII.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.9](#q1.9) How do you choose the cases which will be reported?\n\n\nAustLII does not choose which cases will be reported. For some Courts/Tribunals AustLII holds every case decided, for others we hold significant decisions (as selected by the Court), and in others we hold only reported cases. There are very few databases on any other service (electronic or paper based) which include all the decisions of a particular court.\n\n\nIf AustLII's coverage does not include a case you need, you may be able to get it at one of the commercial legal publishers' online subscriber services, your local public library or your nearest university law library.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.10](#q1.10) The publication of the XYZ case is a breach of my privacy. Will you remove it?\n\n\nThis is not an argument with AustLII, but with the nature of our legal system itself. It is a basic feature of our system of justice that courts and tribunals conduct their hearings in public and that they publicly report their reasons for judgment. There are only some very narrow exceptions to this principle (victims of crime in certain types of offences or cases involving children for example).\n\n\nThere are two main reasons for the transparency of the Anglo-Australian system of justice:\n\n\n* it is seen as a safeguard against abuse of power by the courts; and\n* it allows for consistency of decision making (and for the operation of our doctrine of precedent).\n\n\nAustLII is only one of the mechanisms by which courts and tribunals publish their decisions. Many are also reported in a number of paper-based series of law reports, on subscription CD-ROM by commercial legal publishers, and on commercial legal publishers' own subscription-based websites. These publications are available in most Law Libraries and the legal section of some of the larger public libraries around Australia.\n\n\nIf you still feel that you'd like to have the case removed from AustLII's website, then AustLII has some procedures in place to deal with your request:\n\n\n1. First, contact AustLII at AustLII Feedback and let us know the exact location of the case (or cases) that you would like removed.\n2. Without waiting for a reply from AustLII, immediately contact the Registrar of the court or tribunal which handed down the decision (see the WhitePages for contact information). Let them know that you want either a suppression order on the case or for your name to be removed. Provide full contact details as well as case numbers, citation and decision date.\n\n\nLet us know that you have contacted the court or tribunal.\n\n\nIf the court or tribunal agrees to your request they will contact us directly with a suppression order or a new version of the case with your name replaced by an initial. Please be aware that each court and tribunal will have specific guidelines on the cicumstances in which this will be done.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.11](#q1.11) When are you going to provide transcripts of cases?\n\n\nAt present, transcripts of most cases are only generated from tapes on demand, at some cost. We are not currently planning to provide transcripts of cases as a general service.\n\n\nHowever, the High Court provides AustLII with transcripts of proceedings. The transcripts date from 1996 and can be found at the High Court of Australia Transcripts database page.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.12](#q1.12) Who inserts medium neutral citations in Court and Tribunal decisions?\n\n\nWhere a citation in a decision of a Court or Tribunal is missing the medium neutral version, AustLII uses an automated system based on LawCite to insert the medium neutral citation. This results in the occasional insertion of an incorrect medium neutral citation. For more details, see the LawCite help documentation\n\n\n\n[2](#q2) Searching and SINO\n---------------------------\n\n\n\n### [2.1](#q2.1) How can I find the context of a search term?\n\n\nAfter search results have been returned, pick the document you want to look at. At the top of the page will be a link called [Context] -- if you click on it, it should indicate where in the document your search term occurred. Click on the up and down arrows next to each highlighted search term to navigate through the document to see where else your search terms appear.\n\n\n\n\n### [2.2](#q2.2) How do I find materials which refer/link to what I am viewing?\n\n\nIn the case of legislation and High Court cases, persistent references allow you to easily find links to the document you are viewing. This is accomplished simply through the use of the [Noteup] link at the top (or bottom) of the document you are viewing. The use of this link will generate a search for references to the document you are viewing.\n\n\n\n\n### [2.3](#q2.3) Why isn't search working properly?\n\n\nIn 99.99% of cases that someone has suggested that the search engine is broken or not working properly when using the \"all of these words\", \"phrase\" or Boolean find types, the problem is that the person either (a) has forgotten about the existence of the common word list, or (b) is not aware of the common word list. For an explanation of the common word list, see the answer to Q2.4 below. To include common words in searches, prefix these with a '+' or '#' character.\n\n\n\n\n### [2.4](#q2.4) What are the common words in SINO?\n\n\n\"Common words\" are words that are not indexed by the search engine as they occur so often as to be practically useless search terms. As common words are not indexed, you cannot search for them. Common words are stripped from searches before they are undertaken to improve speed and efficiency. The current list of common words is available at the common words help page. To include common words in searches, prefix these with a '+' or '#' character.\n\n\n\n\n### [2.5](#q2.5) Where does the SINO search engine come from?\n\n\nThe SINO search engine was written by Andrew Mowbray especially for AustLII. It is a free text retrieval engine intended for use with httpd and other embedded applications. \n\n\n\n\n\n### [2.6](#q2.6) Can I get SINO?\n\n\nSINO is Free Open Source Software. If you'd like a copy, contact Andrew Mowbray at andrew@austlii.edu.au.\n\n\n\n[3](#q3) Network Access, Speed and Reliability\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n### [3.1](#q3.1) AustLII seems very slow!\n\n\nThere are usually two bottlenecks between AustLII and Australian end users…\n\n\n1. **Your Internet Service Provider (ISP):** It is common practice in the ISP business to oversell bandwidth. This means that your ISP is trying to cram as many users as possible onto their connection to the Internet. This usually means that your connection slows down.\n2. **The Optus (AARNet) Backbone:** For the technical souls out there, AustLII equipment is connected to the outside world via the University of Technology, Sydney which is also the home of the Sydney Regional Network Organisation. This means that AustLII has very fast access to the AARNet 2 Backbone.\n\n\n\n[4](#q4) Browsers, Viewing, Downloading and Printing\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n### [4.1](#q4.1) How do I download a file?\n\n\nWhere available, use the [Download] link at the top of a document. This will provide a menu of download formats. Choose \"RTF\" in preference to \"plain text\" where it is available.\n\n\nSee generally, the Downloading files help pages.\n\n\n\n\n### [4.2](#q4.2) Which browser is best for viewing AustLII?\n\n\nAustLII materials can be displayed with virtually any browser. Most users currently use Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.\n\n\n\n\n### [4.3](#q4.3) Can I download an entire Act/database in HTML?\n\n\nEntire Acts and regulations are available in a single file by using the [Download] link available at the at the top (and bottom) of the Table of Provisions and at the top (and bottom) of each section of the Act or Regulation. See further Legislation Help.\n\n\n\n\n### [4.4](#q4.4) Can I access AustLII materials via FTP?\n\n\nNo; HTTP provides a similar level of functionality to anonymous FTP and is implemented more securely.

AustLII - The Organisation](#q7)\n\n\n\n\n[1](#q1) Content, Databases and Markup\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n### [1.1](#q1.1) I have found a wrong (or acontextual) link!\n\n\nThis is the product of the massively automated \"markup\" software used by AustLII to insert hypertext links. The software is essentially heuristic in nature - that is, it makes 'intelligent guesses' and therefore also makes the occasional mistake, such as a link to the section of an incorrect Act where the context of the case does not make it clear which Act is referred to. Many of these mistakes relate to the nature of the English (and particularly legal) language. We continue to improve the heuristics used by the markup software.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.2](#q1.2) I have found a broken link!\n\n\nBroken links (ie links which produce a file not found message) can usually be fixed and should be reported to AustLII Feedback, with details of the URL of the page where the link is located and what you expected to find.\n\n\nNote that we cannot fix broken links which are not located on our web site.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.3](#q1.3) How do you do the hypertext markup?\n\n\nThe software to mark up AustLII's databases is the result of a number of years of development. The heuristic rules that it embodies continue to be refined to deal with the nuances of the various databases available via AustLII.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.4](#q1.4) Why is the alphabetic list of cases wrong?\n\n\nThe alphabetic list of cases which is available from the opening pages of some databases is generated automatically from the cases in the database. Unfortunately this may mean that the list of cases is not as useful as it might be, since case names provided by courts and tribunals can include first names and other details.\n\n\nIf you do not find a particular case name by browsing the alphabetic list:\n\n\n* use the [Case Name Search] facility from the Case Database Index page; or\n* use the Search AustLII page, choose the \"this case name\" find option, and select the relevant case database(s) to search.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.5](#q1.5) How do I find the XYZ Act or Regulation?\n\n\n* **Using Autosearch:** The simplest way to find an Act or a section an Act is to just type the name and or section reference into the search box on the AustLII opening page. Austsearch will detect this and will diplay a list of matching legislation from all jurisdictions.\n* **Browsing:** If you know the jurisdiction (ie Commnwealth, NSW etc) name of the Act or Regulation for which you are looking, the best approach may be to browse for it by clicking on the relevant jurisdiction from the AustLII Databases page, choosing the appropriate act or regulation database, and then selecting from the alphabetical list.\n* **Searching:** If you do not know the jurisdiction (ie Commonwealth, NSW etc), but know the name of the Act or Regulation for which you are looking, go to the Search AustLII page, set your find type to this legislation name and select \"All Legislation Databases\" for the databases to search. If you do know the name of the jurisdiction, then select the appropriate database (eg \"NSW: All Legislation\").\n\n\n\n\n### [1.6](#q1.6) How up to date is the XYZ database?\n\n\nThe simplest way to check database currency is via the \"Update Status\" links on the front page.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.7](#q1.7) Does AustLII publish an authorised version of XYZ?\n\n\nThe reproduction of legal materials on AustLII is always with copyright and data permissions of the Courts or Legislatures. However, this permission should not be read as having granted 'authorised' status to the AustLII published version.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.8](#q1.8) When will materials from XYZ be added to AustLII?\n\n\nWe are always negotiating for the addition of new materials to the AustLII databases. There is a recognised advantage in the use of comprehensive sources when undertaking legal research, and we aim to make AustLII the most comprehensive resource for Australian legal research.\n\n\nIf you work for a court or tribunal that does not have its materials published on AustLII then we encourage you to contact us at AustLII Feedback to discuss arrangements. If you'd like to see a particular court or tribunal on AustLII then contact the court or tribunal and suggest to them that they publish on AustLII.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.9](#q1.9) How do you choose the cases which will be reported?\n\n\nAustLII does not choose which cases will be reported. For some Courts/Tribunals AustLII holds every case decided, for others we hold significant decisions (as selected by the Court), and in others we hold only reported cases. There are very few databases on any other service (electronic or paper based) which include all the decisions of a particular court.\n\n\nIf AustLII's coverage does not include a case you need, you may be able to get it at one of the commercial legal publishers' online subscriber services, your local public library or your nearest university law library.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.10](#q1.10) The publication of the XYZ case is a breach of my privacy. Will you remove it?\n\n\nThis is not an argument with AustLII, but with the nature of our legal system itself. It is a basic feature of our system of justice that courts and tribunals conduct their hearings in public and that they publicly report their reasons for judgment. There are only some very narrow exceptions to this principle (victims of crime in certain types of offences or cases involving children for example).\n\n\nThere are two main reasons for the transparency of the Anglo-Australian system of justice:\n\n\n* it is seen as a safeguard against abuse of power by the courts; and\n* it allows for consistency of decision making (and for the operation of our doctrine of precedent).\n\n\nAustLII is only one of the mechanisms by which courts and tribunals publish their decisions. Many are also reported in a number of paper-based series of law reports, on subscription CD-ROM by commercial legal publishers, and on commercial legal publishers' own subscription-based websites. These publications are available in most Law Libraries and the legal section of some of the larger public libraries around Australia.\n\n\nIf you still feel that you'd like to have the case removed from AustLII's website, then AustLII has some procedures in place to deal with your request:\n\n\n1. First, contact AustLII at AustLII Feedback and let us know the exact location of the case (or cases) that you would like removed.\n2. Without waiting for a reply from AustLII, immediately contact the Registrar of the court or tribunal which handed down the decision (see the WhitePages for contact information). Let them know that you want either a suppression order on the case or for your name to be removed. Provide full contact details as well as case numbers, citation and decision date.\n\n\nLet us know that you have contacted the court or tribunal.\n\n\nIf the court or tribunal agrees to your request they will contact us directly with a suppression order or a new version of the case with your name replaced by an initial. Please be aware that each court and tribunal will have specific guidelines on the cicumstances in which this will be done.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.11](#q1.11) When are you going to provide transcripts of cases?\n\n\nAt present, transcripts of most cases are only generated from tapes on demand, at some cost. We are not currently planning to provide transcripts of cases as a general service.\n\n\nHowever, the High Court provides AustLII with transcripts of proceedings. The transcripts date from 1996 and can be found at the High Court of Australia Transcripts database page.\n\n\n\n\n### [1.12](#q1.12) Who inserts medium neutral citations in Court and Tribunal decisions?\n\n\nWhere a citation in a decision of a Court or Tribunal is missing the medium neutral version, AustLII uses an automated system based on LawCite to insert the medium neutral citation. This results in the occasional insertion of an incorrect medium neutral citation. For more details, see the LawCite help documentation\n\n\n\n[2](#q2) Searching and SINO\n---------------------------\n\n\n\n### [2.1](#q2.1) How can I find the context of a search term?\n\n\nAfter search results have been returned, pick the document you want to look at. At the top of the page will be a link called [Context] -- if you click on it, it should indicate where in the document your search term occurred. Click on the up and down arrows next to each highlighted search term to navigate through the document to see where else your search terms appear.\n\n\n\n\n### [2.2](#q2.2) How do I find materials which refer/link to what I am viewing?\n\n\nIn the case of legislation and High Court cases, persistent references allow you to easily find links to the document you are viewing. This is accomplished simply through the use of the [Noteup] link at the top (or bottom) of the document you are viewing. The use of this link will generate a search for references to the document you are viewing.\n\n\n\n\n### [2.3](#q2.3) Why isn't search working properly?\n\n\nIn 99.99% of cases that someone has suggested that the search engine is broken or not working properly when using the \"all of these words\", \"phrase\" or Boolean find types, the problem is that the person either (a) has forgotten about the existence of the common word list, or (b) is not aware of the common word list. For an explanation of the common word list, see the answer to Q2.4 below. To include common words in searches, prefix these with a '+' or '#' character.\n\n\n\n\n### [2.4](#q2.4) What are the common words in SINO?\n\n\n\"Common words\" are words that are not indexed by the search engine as they occur so often as to be practically useless search terms. As common words are not indexed, you cannot search for them. Common words are stripped from searches before they are undertaken to improve speed and efficiency. The current list of common words is available at the common words help page. To include common words in searches, prefix these with a '+' or '#' character.\n\n\n\n\n### [2.5](#q2.5) Where does the SINO search engine come from?\n\n\nThe SINO search engine was written by Andrew Mowbray especially for AustLII. It is a free text retrieval engine intended for use with httpd and other embedded applications. \n\n\n\n\n\n### [2.6](#q2.6) Can I get SINO?\n\n\nSINO is Free Open Source Software. If you'd like a copy, contact Andrew Mowbray at andrew@austlii.edu.au.\n\n\n\n[3](#q3) Network Access, Speed and Reliability\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n### [3.1](#q3.1) AustLII seems very slow!\n\n\nThere are usually two bottlenecks between AustLII and Australian end users…\n\n\n1. **Your Internet Service Provider (ISP):** It is common practice in the ISP business to oversell bandwidth. This means that your ISP is trying to cram as many users as possible onto their connection to the Internet. This usually means that your connection slows down.\n2. **The Optus (AARNet) Backbone:** For the technical souls out there, AustLII equipment is connected to the outside world via the University of Technology, Sydney which is also the home of the Sydney Regional Network Organisation. This means that AustLII has very fast access to the AARNet 2 Backbone.\n\n\n\n[4](#q4) Browsers, Viewing, Downloading and Printing\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n### [4.1](#q4.1) How do I download a file?\n\n\nWhere available, use the [Download] link at the top of a document. This will provide a menu of download formats. Choose \"RTF\" in preference to \"plain text\" where it is available.\n\n\nSee generally, the Downloading files help pages.\n\n\n\n\n### [4.2](#q4.2) Which browser is best for viewing AustLII?\n\n\nAustLII materials can be displayed with virtually any browser. Most users currently use Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.\n\n\n\n\n### [4.3](#q4.3) Can I download an entire Act/database in HTML?\n\n\nEntire Acts and regulations are available in a single file by using the [Download] link available at the at the top (and bottom) of the Table of Provisions and at the top (and bottom) of each section of the Act or Regulation. See further Legislation Help.\n\n\n\n\n### [4.4](#q4.4) Can I access AustLII materials via FTP?\n\n\nNo; HTTP provides a similar level of functionality to anonymous FTP and is implemented more securely. FTP of AustLII materials is not planned for the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Tribunal was hearing an\napplication by the first defendant for a declaration under [Part 3](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/index.html#p3) of the [Child\nProtection (Prohibited Employment) Act 1998](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/) (\"The Act\").  \n  \n  \n  \n2 The first\ndefendant, V, is now a married man aged about 38. He has five children ranging\nin age from 7 to 18. He has 9 nieces\nand nephews who at various times have been\nin his care and home often for extended periods.  \n  \n  \n  \n3 He has coached a boys'\nsoccer team for the past 8 years and has also been involved with his son's\nschool chess club and with being\nresponsible for transporting his son and other\nyoung boys to and from sporting fixtures organised by the school.  \n  \n  \n  \n4 In\nabout 1980, V was convicted of carnal knowledge. He was 17 years old at the\ntime and the girl involved was about 15. It would\nappear that this was a case\nwhere V and the woman concerned were in a close emotional relationship. Whilst\nthose facts might suggest\nthat the offence was not the most serious case of\ncarnal knowledge, it must be pointed out that V did not marry the woman in\nquestion\nand that there is some suggestion that she was a vulnerable person at\nthe time.  \n  \n  \n  \n5 That conviction amounted to a conviction for a serious sex\noffence within the meaning of [s 5(3)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s5.html) of the Act.  \n  \n  \n  \n6 The consequence is\nthat under [s 5(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s5.html) of the Act, V is a prohibited person unless there is in force\nan order under [s 9](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) of the Act declaring that the Act is not to apply to\nhim.  \n  \n  \n  \n7 V accordingly made the application for an order declaring that the\nAct not apply to him. Under [s 9(2)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) of the Act, the application is made to the\nIndustrial Relations Tribunal if the applicant is an employee or otherwise the\nAdministrative\nDecisions Tribunal. V thus applied to the Tribunal.  \n  \n  \n  \n8 The\nsection provides in sub-section (4) that the Tribunal:  \n  \n  \n  \n\"is not to make an\norder under this section unless it considers that the person the subject of the\nproposed order does not pose a\nrisk to the safety of\nchildren.\"  \n  \n  \n  \nSub-section (5) provides that:  \n  \n  \n  \n\"In deciding whether or\nnot to make an order under this section in relation to a person, a relevant\ntribunal is to take into account\nthe following: ...\".  \n  \n  \n  \n9 Six matters are\nthen set out in sub-section (5), viz:  \n  \n  \n  \n\"(a) the seriousness of the\noffences with respect to which the person is a prohibited person,  \n  \n  \n  \n(b) the\nage of the person at the time those offences were committed,  \n  \n  \n  \n(c) the age\nof each victim of the offences at the time they were committed,  \n  \n  \n  \n(d) the\ndifference in age between the prohibited person and each such\nvictim,  \n  \n  \n  \n(e) the seriousness of the prohibited person's total criminal\nrecord,  \n  \n  \n  \n(f) such other matters as the tribunal considers\nrelevant.\"  \n  \n  \n  \n10 Sub-section (9) says \"Orders under this section may be made\nsubject to conditions\". Other parts of the section which should be\nmentioned\nare that sub-section 8 means that if an order is refused, no fresh application\ncould be made for five years unless the\nTribunal otherwise orders at the time of\nrefusal, and sub-section 11 which says that an appeal lies on a question of law\nto the Supreme\nCourt by any party to the proceedings.  \n  \n  \n  \n11 [The Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/) requires\nthat the Commission for Children and Young People is to be a party to any\nproceedings for an order under [s 9](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) (s [9](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html)(7)). The Commission was constituted by\nthe [Commission for Children and Young People Act 1998](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) as a corporation. Under\nthe Commission's Act s 10, the safety, welfare and well-being of children are\nthe paramount considerations\nfor the Commission. Under Part 7 of the\nCommission's Act, it is to protect children by means of employment screening for\nany employment\nthat involves direct contact with children for the purpose of\nprotecting children from child abuse. [The Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/) sets out a very draconian regime\nwith respect to screening potential operators and employees of enterprises\nproviding services for\nchildren including a provision for notification of any\nrelevant disciplinary proceedings that might be taken at any time against\nan\nemployee in such enterprises.  \n  \n  \n  \n12 The evidence before the Tribunal was\nthat V, apart from his conviction for carnal knowledge, had six other\nconvictions, the latest\nof which was 25 July 1988. Four of these were for\nstealing, and two (one involving three incidents) for being near buildings with\nintent to peep and pry. None of these are serious sex offences within the\nmeaning of the Act.  \n  \n  \n  \n13 The Tribunal ordered that the Act is not to apply\nto V on condition that V \"not engage in any child-related employment ...\ninvolving\nfemales between the ages of 12 and 18 years.\"  \n  \n  \n  \n14 The Commission\nappeals on five grounds which can be summarised as follows:  \n  \n  \n  \n(1) The\nTribunal appeared to take the view that it was a matter for the Commission to\nshow that an applicant under [s 9](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) does pose a risk to children on the\n**Briginshaw** standard, whereas the proper construction of the section is\nthat it is for the applicant on the **Briginshaw** standard to show that he\ndoes not pose a risk to children.  \n  \n  \n  \n(2) That as the Tribunal had come to\nthe conclusion that the applicant posed a risk to some children, it should not\nhave made any\norder at all in his favour.  \n  \n  \n  \n(3) That the Tribunal erred in\nholding that the test contained in sub-section (4) was not a condition precedent\nto making an order\nunder [s 9.](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html)  \n  \n  \n  \n(4) That the Tribunal was in error in\nholding that the test in sub-section (4) could be met by taking into account any\nconditions\nthe Tribunal intended to impose pursuant to sub-section (9); \nand  \n  \n  \n  \n(5) That the condition imposed did not in fact address the risk which\nthe Tribunal had assessed.  \n  \n  \n  \n15 On the appeal, Mr P Singleton of counsel\nappeared for the appellant, and Ms M Dudhee for the respondent.  \n  \n  \n  \n16 There\nhas been very little judicial consideration of [s 9](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) of the Act because of its\nrelative newness. Wright P, in the Industrial Commission, considered interim\norders in **A v Commission for Children and Young People (No 2)**  [(2000) 104\nIR 119](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282000%29%20104%20IR%20119 \"View LawCiteRecord\"), but there is little in his Honour's reasoning which is of assistance in\nthe instant case. There have also been various unreported\ndecisions in the\nIndustrial Commisson such as **G v J & H**  [[2001] NSWIR Comm 69](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%20NSWIR%20Comm%2069 \"View LawCiteRecord\"), a\ndecision of Kavanagh J and **L v Commission for Children and Young People** [[2001] NSWIR Comm 134](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%20NSWIR%20Comm%20134 \"View LawCiteRecord\"), a decision of Petersen J.  \n  \n  \n  \n17 In that case\nPetersen J said of [s 9(4):](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html)  \n  \n  \n  \n\"This test raises a question the answer to\nwhich in a given case may not readily appear. Risk is a concept the parameters\nof which\nmay vary from the perspective of the assessor, but more particularly\nwill also vary according to the known facts. On one view of\nit, the exposure of\nchildren to adults, even in the usually supremely safe context of child and\nparent, will always contain the possibility\nof a risk to the safety of a child. \nHowever, in the absence of some indication of actual risk, for example from a\nparent, the position\nwill be that the child is to be regarded as not at risk. \nRisk in the context of the Act does not seem to me to be concerned with\nwhat may\nbe mere possibilities, but rather an exposure to a situation which involves a\nrecognisable potential for harm. The existence\nof that potential will require\nsome foundation in fact. The absence of that recognisable potential, it being\nthat absence which\nby the Act by its negative expression of the test in [s 9(4)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html)\nrequires before an order can be made will depend on the tribunal finding some\nfactual basis for the view that there exists no risk.\n What will amount to a\nsufficient basis for such a view must, I think, remain an issue for each case,\ngiven the wide-ranging variations\nin circumstances which may\npresent.\"  \n  \n  \n  \n18 The most important of the cases to which I have been\nreferred is the decision of Haylen J in **R v Commission for Children and Young\nPeople**  [[2002] NSWIR Comm 101.](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWIRComm/2002/101.html \"View Case\") That is a 97 page judgment delivered on 16\nMay 2002 in which his Honour thoroughly considered the Act and the role of the\nIndustrial\nCommission in making orders under [s 9.](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html)  \n  \n  \n  \n19 Before I analyse his\nHonour's judgment I should note that many of the submissions that were made by\nMr Singleton to me were fairly\nclose to those put to Haylen J and soundly\nrejected by him in **R's case**.  \n  \n  \n  \n20 These submissions\nwere:  \n  \n  \n  \n(A) That sub-section (4) involves a threshold test. If the\nthreshold is not passed, that is an end to the matter. If it is passed,\nthen\nthe Tribunal's discretion comes in examining the factors set out in sub-section\n(5).  \n  \n  \n  \n(B) If, within sub-section (4) a person presents a risk to some\nsections of children, he poses a risk to the safety of children and\nno order can\nbe made.  \n  \n  \n  \n(C) It is not possible to say that a condition of the order can\nremove a person from being a risk to children to being no risk to\nchildren.  \n  \n  \n  \n(D) There is no warrant for reading the word \"acceptable\"\nbefore \"risk\" in sub-section (4) as no risk is acceptable. A minimal risk\nis\nstill a risk so long as the risk is a real risk and not a fanciful or\ntheoretical risk. The risk, however, does not have to be\nsubstantial; cf\n**Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG** [[1998] UKHL 52](http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/52.html \"View Case\"); [[1999] 2 AC 222](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%202%20AC%20222 \"View LawCiteRecord\"), 236-7.  \n  \n  \n  \n21 At [100],\nHaylen J said:  \n  \n  \n  \n\"I am not able to accept the submission for the respondent\nCommission that, so long as there is any risk however minimal, an applicant\nmay\nreoffend and therefore pose a risk to the safety of children, then an order and\ndeclaration of [s 9(4)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) cannot be made.\"  \n  \n  \n  \nHis Honour said this because he\nwas of the view that Parliament could not have intended to set up a statutory\nright to make an application\nif the only people who could make the application\nwere, because of their previous convictions for a serious sexual offence, denied\nany ability to obtain an order because they were by definition some risk, see\n[101]. His Honour examined the Second Reading Speech\nin the Lower House that\nthe purpose of the screening related policies and procedures were to reduce\nunacceptable risks of people\nworking with children. Furthermore, in the\nLegislative Council the Attorney-General had said that the object of the series\nof Bills,\nincluding the Bill for the present Act and the [Commission for Children\nand Young People Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) was \"to achieve a balance between protecting employees and\nprotecting children from abuse. It is important that we protect reasonable\ncivil liberties.\" His Honour also referred to the fact that the Wood Royal\nCommission from which the legislation had its genesis\nreferred to an\n\"unacceptable risk certificate\".  \n  \n  \n  \n22 His Honour then referred to [s 34](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s34.html) of\nthe [Commission for Children and Young People Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) which is part of the employment\nscreening provisions and which speaks in terms of employment screening having as\nits purpose \"An\nassessment of the risk to children involved ... arising from\nanything disclosed by such a check, having regard to all the circumstances\nof\nthe case.\" His Honour thus said that what 9(4) was focused on was \"not a mere\ntheoretical or possible risk arising from the fact\nof a previous conviction, but\nit is a reference to an unacceptable risk, a real risk, a likelihood of harm or\na recognisable potential\nhaving regard to the need to jointly protect children\nand employees and to preserve reasonable civil rights.\" [104]  \n  \n  \n  \n23 His\nHonour then went on to say that \"It might well be that by the imposition of\nconditions under [s 9(9)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s9.html), the operation of the Act is not to apply to a\nprohibited person so long as that person undertakes a particular type of\nemployment\"\n[105].  \n  \n  \n  \n24 His Honour concluded that the applicant bore the\nonus of establishing that he was not a risk and that was \"to a high standard\"\n[130]. However, he rejected the idea that there was a two-stage procedure, the\napplicant first establishing that he was not a risk\nto children, and if he\novercomes that threshold, whether or not the Tribunal was prepared to exercise\nits discretion in his favour.\n He also rejected the submission that it was not\npermissible to impose conditions in order to lift the applicant over the\nthreshold\nof risk. His Honour said that given that the legislation takes away a\nfundamental human right to work, it is very unlikely that\nthe legislature\nintended to place additional barriers in the way of an applicant other than the\nultimate and understandable requirement\nto meet the test set out in 9(4). He\nvirtually said that the construction urged on the Industrial Commission by the\npresent plaintiff\ninvolved an applicant having to face \"artificial barriers\nconstructed by a convoluted approach to statutory construction\". The purpose\nof\nthe Act was not to impose additional punishment on a person, but to eliminate\npossible risks \"That purpose is not achieved by\nadopting an approach to\nstatutory construction which places unwarranted barriers in the way of an\napplicant additional to those found\nin the combination of [s 9(4)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s9.html) and [s 9(5).\"](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s9.html)\n[96]  \n  \n  \n  \n25 Finally, his Honour said that it should be noted that the power\nto impose conditions in sub-section (9) applies both at the stage\nof making an\ninterim stay order under sub-section (6) as well as the making of a final order\nwhich suggests that conditions have\na more important and wider role than\nsuggested by the present plaintiff.  \n  \n  \n  \n26 Mr Singleton, respectfully as he\ncould, submitted that the decision of Haylen J was simply wrong and should not\nbe followed.  \n  \n  \n  \n27 I should now deal with the decision of Deputy President\nHennessy. With great respect to the learned Deputy President, her judgment\ncontains errors and inconsistencies, but some of these cancel each other out. \nThe decision was made on 6 June 2001 so that the Deputy\nPresident did not have\naccess to **R's case**.  \n  \n  \n  \n28 The Deputy President found that the onus\nwas on the present plaintiff to show that the applicant was a risk to children. \nThat\nis clearly wrong. The onus is on the applicant on the **Briginshaw**standard to show that he is not a risk to children. However, although the\nDeputy President found that that was the test she had to\napply, she came to the\nconclusion that on the **Briginshaw** standard, the plaintiff had established\nthat the respondent was a risk to children. However, in doing so she applied\nthe test that\na risk, however minimal, was a risk within the meaning of [s\n9(4).](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s9.html)  \n  \n  \n  \n29 The Deputy President spent some considerable time in her\njudgment in assessing whether [s 9(4)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s9.html) constituted a jurisdictional fact or\ncondition precedent to the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion. She analysed\n**Enfield Corp v Development Assessment Commission** [[2000] HCA 5](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2000/5.html \"View Case\"); [(2000) 199 CLR 135](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282000%29%20199%20CLR%20135 \"View LawCiteRecord\") and\n**Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority** [[1998] HCA 28](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/28.html \"View Case\"); [(1998) 194 CLR 355](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20194%20CLR%20355 \"View LawCiteRecord\")\nand came to the view that [s 9(4)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s9.html) did not constitute a jurisdictional fact but\nwas a matter which is incidental to the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion. \nPart\nof her reasoning was that otherwise [s 9(9)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s9.html) was otiose.  \n  \n  \n  \n30 As I have\nsaid, Mr Singleton criticises this view, but it is consistent with the view\nreached by Haylen J.  \n  \n  \n  \n31 In this background it seems to me I must address\na series of questions which I will set out shortly. However, before I do so I\nshould state one other matter which is a matter of concern.  \n  \n  \n  \n32 In modern\nlitigation it is axiomatic that expert evidence should be independent and the\nexpert should virtually be the Court's\nexpert to assist the Court in reaching\nthe truth. In the present case, the Tribunal heard evidence from a Ms Howell\nwho appears\nto be a psychologist closely linked to the plaintiff. Her exact\nrelationship to the plaintiff does not appear. Ms Howell wrote\nthree reports. \nHer report was changed on three occasions. Counsel for V put to Ms Howell that\nthere were three reasons for that:\n (a) she was incompetent; (b) she changed\nher report to assist the plaintiff's case in the hope that she would obtain\nongoing\nwork from the plaintiff; and (c) that she was manipulated into\nsubstituting her original conclusion for a totally inconsistent\nconclusion.  \n  \n  \n  \n33 The Deputy President said that she accepted that Ms Howell\nwas telling the truth when she gave evidence about the reasons for\nchanging her\nreport and that she did not change her report because she was manipulated or\nbecause she wanted to please the Commission\nin order to obtain more\nwork.  \n  \n  \n  \n34 This is a finding of fact with which I am not asked to\ninterfere, nor could I even if I were asked to interfere. Nor do I know\nthe\nfacts and circumstances in which V's counsel alleged that the witness had been\nmanipulated. However, I should take the opportunity\nof saying that the modern\napproach to expert evidence is that the expert should be beyond criticism of\nbias. If an applicant sees\na psychologist who is paid for by the Commission\nthen it is quite understandable that (as is the situation in the present case)\nthe\napplicant feels that he is denied justice when an initial favourable report\nto him is amended to an unfavourable report with no further\ninput from him but\nwith some apparent input from officers of the plaintiff.  \n  \n  \n  \n35 I agree with\nCampbell J in **Kirch Communications Pty Ltd v Gene Engineering Pty Ltd** [[2002] NSWSC 485](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/485.html \"View Case\") that even the failure to comply with [Part 36](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/index.html#p36) Rule 13C of\nthe Supreme Court Rules is not a ground for rejecting so-called expert evidence.\nHowever, the Court's stand on ensuring\nas much as it can that expert evidence is\nas free from suspicion as possible must be backed up by the\nprofession.  \n  \n  \n  \n36 I now turn to the questions that need to be addressed. \nThese are:  \n  \n  \n  \n(1) Is the right to work of any, and if so what, significance,\nwhen construing [s 9](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) of the [Child Protection (Prohibited Employment) Act\n1998](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/)?  \n  \n  \n  \n(2) What is the meaning of \"risk\" in [s 9(4)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) of that\nAct?  \n  \n  \n  \n(3) Does [s 9(4)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) of the Act impose a two-tier decision-making process\non the Tribunal?  \n  \n  \n  \n(4) What is the significance of [s 9(9)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) of the\nAct?  \n  \n  \n  \n(5) What orders should be made in the instant case?  \n  \n  \n  \nI will\ndeal with each of these matters in turn.  \n  \n  \n  \n37 (1) I have stated this\nquestion first because it seems to me that its answer may provide a clue to the\ngeneral approach that one\nmust take to the section.  \n  \n  \n  \n38 As I have already\nnoted, Haylen J in **R**, placed considerable emphasis on the right to work. \nIn addition to his reference to the fundamental nature of the right and its\nprotection by United Nations protocols, his Honour also drew attention to the\nfact that there is a dichotomy between situations where\nthe prohibited person\nmay lose his or her job because of the statute and other situations. His Honour\nsays that this can only be\nbecause there is a balancing exercise to be carried\nout an assessment of risk to children on the one hand and the right to work on\nthe other.  \n  \n  \n  \n39 The present case does not deal with a person in paid\nemployment so that the direct consideration of the right to work does not\nenter\ninto the case. However, his Honour's point still remains, why would the\nIndustrial Commission be given jurisdiction to deal\nwith an application under [s\n9](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) of the Act unless it involved some assessment of the right to work over the\nrisk to children?  \n  \n  \n  \n40 I cannot see any reason to gainsay his Honour's\nthought processes. Moreover, what his Honour says is reinforced by reference to\nthe Minister's Second Reading Speeches about acceptable risks and that there\nmust be a balancing of protecting employees, protecting\nchildren from abuse, and\nprotecting reasonable civil liberties.  \n  \n  \n  \n41 It follows that when\napproaching the construction of [s 9](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) one must not approach the matter on the\nbasis that the sole criterion is to protect children from any possibility of\nabuse from a\nperson who has been convicted of a serious sex\noffence.  \n  \n  \n  \n42 (2) It almost follows, from what I have just said, that one\ndoes not define risk as meaning minimal risk. One would in any case\nas Mr\nSingleton has submitted, exclude fanciful or theoretical risks, but what one is\nlooking for is whether, in all the circumstances,\nthere is a real and\nappreciable risk in the sense of a risk that is greater than the risk of any\nadult preying on a child. One,\nhowever, must link the word \"risk\" with the\nwords that follow, namely, \"to the safety of children\". The approach of the\nplaintiff\nis to say that children must be read as children generally, and if\nthere is a risk to a section of children which is constituted\nby a large number\nof children, then there is a risk to children generally. So that, if in the\npresent case it be said that Mr V\nis a risk to female teenage children, then he\nis a risk to children generally.  \n  \n  \n  \n43 I very much wonder whether that is a\nproper construction of the Act. If it is to be read so as to preserve a\nbalancing exercise,\nI would have thought a more balanced view of the section is\na risk to the safety of children bearing in mind all the circumstances\nin which\nthe prohibited person is likely to be employed. If a person is only going to be\nemployed amongst boy children, then the\nfact that he might be a risk to girl\nchildren may be quite irrelevant.  \n  \n  \n  \n44 As against this, there is the fact\nthat under the section a prohibited person is either declared to be a person to\nwhom the Act\ndoes not apply, or else no declaration is made. The answer which\nMs Dudhee gives to this is that the power under [s 9(9)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/s9.html) can be brought into play.\nThat is, for instance, a declaration can be made subject, for instance to the\ncondition that the declaration\nwill cease to have effect if the person changes\nhis or her current employment or if he or she commences to work with different\ntypes\nof children.  \n  \n  \n  \n45 (3) I think the answer to this question is Yes and\nNo. There is a two-tier decision-making process in the sense that the Tribunal\nmaking the decision must have two foci. Dealing with these foci in no\nparticular order, one focus is the serious sex offence and\nits circumstances,\nthe second is the current danger, if any, posed by the applicant to children. \nSub-section (5) deals mainly with\nthe first focus, that is, that the Tribunal\nmust evaluate the seriousness of the offences taking into account the age of the\napplicant\nwhen the offences were committed, the age of the \"victim\" at the time\nand the difference in ages. The second involves the assessment\nof the\napplicant's character now which includes the seriousness of the prohibited\nperson's total criminal record, a matter mentioned\nby (5)(e) and any other\nmatter which the Tribunal considers relevant. Sub-section (5) then deals partly\nwith one focus and partly\nwith the other. Although the Tribunal has to focus\nits attention on (a) the original crime; and (b) the applicant's current\ncharacter,\nall these matters must come together when the Tribunal is making a\ndecision as to whether to exempt the person from the effect of\nthe Act. The\ndecision is then made in the light of all these matters as to whether the person\ndoes or does not pose a risk to the\nsafety of children. If the person\nestablishes that he or she does not pose a risk to the safety of children, then\nthe Tribunal has\na discretion as to whether or not it will make an order. In\nview of the right to work, however, that discretion would ordinarily\nbe\nexercised in favour of an applicant unless there was a good reason not to so\nexercise it.  \n  \n  \n  \n46 (4) Again I cannot see the warrant for limiting the power\nto make orders subject to conditions. It is right to observe, as it\nhas been\nobserved in the Industrial Commission, that conditional orders apply to any\norder made under the section, including applications\nto stay. Indeed,\nsub-sections (4) and (5) also apply to stay applications. It is almost reading\nthe power to make orders subject\nto conditions out of the Act to say that one\ncannot by imposing conditions on a declaration, make an applicant who may pose\nsome\nrisk to children into an applicant who does not pose a real acceptable risk\nto children. When one considers the purpose of the Act\nand the balancing\nexercise required, such a submission should not be acceded to.  \n  \n  \n  \n47 (5) It\nfollows that although there are errors and inconsistencies in the judgment of\nthe Deputy President, she reached the right\nresult and accordingly the appeal\nshould be dismissed.  \n  \n  \n  \n48 So far as costs are concerned, the normal order\nis that when an appeal is dismissed, the unsuccessful appellant pays the\nsuccessful\nrespondent's costs. That provisional view is reinforced in the\ninstant case by two factors, (a) a principal purpose of this appeal\nwas to\nobtain a definitive construction of the Act for the purpose of the plaintiff\nCommission; and (b) the points had already been\ndecided against the Commission\non almost identical arguments in **R** decided on 16 May 2002.  \n  \n  \n  \n49 I\nfully accept what Mr Singleton says that he personally was unaware of the\ndecision of **Re R** when the oral argument took place and only obtained it\nfrom the Industrial Commission's website shortly after the oral argument. \nHe\ndutifully alerted me immediately to its existence and made submissions that it\nwas distinguishable or wrong.  \n  \n  \n  \n50 However, the plaintiff Commission must\nhave known of the existence of the judgment. It had a solicitor from the Crown\nSolicitor's\nOffice appearing for it and must have been made aware of this\nsignificant judgment, yet it proceeded to instruct counsel to run the\nappeal\nwithout alerting him to the existence of the judgment.  \n  \n  \n  \n51 It may be that\nI or my staff would have found the judgment in any event, but it might well be\nsaid that but for Mr Singleton keeping\nto the time-honoured ethical rules of the\nbar in alerting me to all decisions pro and con his submissions, that the\ndecision in **R** came to the Court's attention. I am extremely displeased\nthat the Commission, which after all, is a governmental authority which\nis\nencouraged to be fair, sought to withhold it from me.

The\n> appellant\n> was off work for a few days after the incident but thereafter remained\n> at work, save for various periods of sick leave, not claimed\n> by him at the time\n> as being due to the original injury, until 26 March 2008, when he went off work,\n> remaining off work on sick leave.\n> The respondent terminated the appellant's\n> employment on 16 October 2008.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 4 | The appellant sought weekly\n> compensation payments from the respondent under the *[Workers Compensation Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/)*1987, claiming that he was suffering from permanent incapacity as a result\n> of the injury to his knee sustained on 31 October 2005. The\n> respondent denied\n> the claim, whereupon the appellant brought proceedings in the Workers\n> Compensation Commission.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 5 | The matter first proceeded\n> before an arbitrator in the Workers Compensation Commission based upon\n> statements by the appellant and\n> other \" *witnesses* \" and by the tender of\n> the medical certificates, reports and other documents. The Arbitrator made an\n> award of weekly compensation\n> in favour of the appellant. The respondent appealed\n> and the appeal was heard and determined by Keating DCJ. The matter also\n> proceeded\n> before his Honour 'on the papers'.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 6 | Both before the Arbitrator and\n> on the appeal to the Commission, the respondent contended that as the appellant\n> did not report the\n> injury and no one witnessed the work incident, it should be\n> inferred that no such incident occurred. Alternatively, the respondent\n> submitted\n> that the appellant's incapacity was not caused by the work incident, but was\n> attributable to subsequent non-work related\n> activities the appellant had\n> undertaken, namely: assisting members of his family to unload bearers and joists\n> from a truck at his\n> home on 22 January 2008; assisting a colleague, Mr\n> Hindmarsh, to move house in late March 2008, when he moved several pieces of\n> heavy\n> furniture; sanding the floor at his home, which involved being on his\n> knees for two days in late April 2008; as well as falling a\n> second time in late\n> March or early April 2008 (the subsequent non-work related incidents).\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 7 | Keating DCJ found that the\n> work incident had occurred and that the appellant injured his right knee as a\n> result. However, his Honour\n> concluded, at [175], that the appellant had failed\n> to discharge the onus of proving that his \" *incapacity commencing on 26 March\n> 2008* [being the date on which the appellant went off work on sick leave]\n> *resulted from the injury sustained on 31 October 2005* \".\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 8 | Integral to this conclusion\n> was his Honour's rejection, at [54], of the evidence of Dr Summersell, the\n> appellant's treating orthopaedic\n> surgeon, as having no weight. This finding\n> appears to have been based on two aspects of Dr Summersell's evidence. First, as\n> Dr Summersell\n> had \" *failed to explain or even consider the effect of the\n> intervening events* \" identified above, his Honour held, at [154], that the\n> facts on which Dr Summersell's opinion was based did not form a proper\n> foundation\n> for it: *Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles*  [[2001] NSWCA\n> 305](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2001/305.html \"View Case\"); [(2001) 52 NSWLR 705](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282001%29%2052%20NSWLR%20705 \"View LawCiteRecord\") at [[85]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2001/305.html#para85).  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 9 | Secondly, his Honour found\n> that in two virtually identical reports of 6 May 2008, Dr Summersell's opinion\n> that the 2005 work incident\n> was the cause of the appellant's incapacity, was\n> given without any explanation of the scientific or other intellectual basis for\n> the conclusion reached. Accordingly, his Honour considered, at [155], that Dr\n> Summersell's opinion failed to satisfy the second limb\n> of *Makita* .\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n**Issues on the appeal**   \n  \n\n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 10 | Four principal issues arose\n> on the appeal. The first and second issues related to his Honour's treatment of\n> the evidence of Dr Summersell.\n> As to the first issue, the appellant contended\n> that in finding that \" *no weight could be placed* \" on Dr Summersell's\n> opinion, Keating DCJ wrongly applied the principles governing expert evidence\n> and, in particular, the principle\n> examined by Heydon JA in *Makita.* |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 11 | As to the second issue, the\n> appellant contended that his Honour denied him procedural fairness in placing no\n> weight on Dr Summersell's\n> opinion when no ' *Makita* objection' had been\n> taken by the respondent. As this had not been raised as an issue in the case the\n> appellant had no opportunity\n> of making submissions to his Honour in respect of\n> the proper application of the *Makita* principle to Dr Summersell's\n> reports.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 12 | With respect to the third\n> issue, the appellant contended that the trial judge's error in placing no weight\n> on Dr Summersell's opinion,\n> was compounded by his refusal to draw a *Jones v\n> Dunkel* inference in the appellant's favour in circumstances where the\n> respondent had failed to tender the report of its own medico-legal\n> expert, Dr\n> Bodel, who had seen the appellant for the purposes of the proceedings: *Jones\n> v Dunkel* [[1959] HCA 8](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html \"View Case\"); [(1959) 101 CLR 298](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298 \"View LawCiteRecord\"); [[1959] ALR 367.](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%20ALR%20367 \"View LawCiteRecord\") |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 13 | As to the fourth issue, the\n> appellant contended that his Honour misdirected himself in law on the issue of\n> causation by failing to\n> ask whether the injury sustained in the work incident\n> rendered the appellant susceptible to the effect of further injury. This\n> question\n> necessarily raised the further and central question whether the\n> subsequent non-work related incidents were caused by that susceptibility.\n> If so,\n> the appellant's continuing incapacity from 26 March 2008 fell within \" *injury*\" within the meaning of the *[Workplace Injury Management and Workers\n> Compensation Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wimawca1998540/)* .  |\n> \n> \n\n\n**Background facts**   \n  \n\n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 14 | The appellant's case was that\n> on 31 October 2005, he was stacking timber when he turned and slipped on a piece\n> of cleat (which is\n> an off-cut piece of timber). He said that his leg slipped\n> from under him and he landed on his backside. He believed he twisted his\n> right\n> knee when he fell and said he felt pain in the back and on either side of his\n> right knee.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 15 | No one saw the appellant fall\n> and he did not report it. The appellant said that, immediately after his fall,\n> he tried to locate a\n> supervisor but none could be found and he did not believe\n> that there was a log book in existence at that time in which to record\n> workplace\n> injuries. However, on 10 May 2006, following a safety meeting conducted by the\n> respondent, the appellant completed a questionnaire\n> concerning, inter alia,\n> previous work injuries in which he stated that he had injured his knee at work\n> the previous year.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 16 | On the day of the work\n> incident, the appellant spoke to a co-worker, Peter Hyde, and told him about the\n> incident but that he was \"\n> *ok* \". The appellant continued to work for the\n> remainder of the day, although his knee was sore. That afternoon the appellant's\n> mother\n> picked him up from work. She noticed he was limping. He did not attend\n> work on 2 or 3 November 2005, but stayed at home and rested\n> his knee.\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 17 | The appellant's mother made\n> an appointment for him to see a medical practitioner, Dr Gak, on 4 November\n> 2005, which she also attended.\n> During the examination and in his mother's\n> presence, Dr Gak asked the appellant how he had come to be injured. When the\n> appellant\n> explained how he was injured, his mother recalled Dr Gak responding\n> with words to the effect: \" *so it's covered by Workers' Compensation?* \"\n> and the appellant replying that he \" *didn't think he was covered because he\n> did not tell a supervisor at work only a mate* \". The appellant said that he\n> had not subsequently reported the injury because he was afraid for his job\n> security.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 18 | The appellant alleged that,\n> following the work incident, his knee progressively became worse. He attended\n> the Grafton Base Hospital\n> on several occasions in 2007 and 2008 and consulted a\n> number of doctors during this time. On 23 June 2008, the appellant underwent\n> a\n> right knee arthroscopic partial medial meniscectomy and chondroplasty, which was\n> carried out by Dr Summersell.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 19 | Mr Hyde, to whom the\n> appellant said he mentioned the incident, stated that he recalled the appellant\n> walking past him in the packing\n> room and observed him to be rubbing his knee. He\n> said that the appellant told him that he had \" *slipped on some timber on the\n> floor but was ok* \". Subsequently, he saw the appellant on occasions with a\n> guard on his knee. Mr Hyde said that in the two and a half years prior to\n> the\n> hearing, the appellant had not mentioned his knee and had not \" *really shown\n> any signs of an injury* \". He also said that \" *I would see [the appellant]\n> with a wrist or knee guard on occasionally but it never affected his work* \".\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 20 | Five other work colleagues\n> gave statements. His Honour summarised their evidence as being to the effect\n> that they were either unaware\n> of any injury suffered by the appellant and/or\n> that the appellant had never complained to them of an injury to his knee or of\n> symptoms\n> relating thereto.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n**Medical treatment and reports and subsequent incidents**   \n  \n\n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 21 | It will be recalled that the\n> work incident occurred on 31 October 2005. The appellant saw Dr Gak on 4\n> November 2005. Dr Gak's notes\n> stated that the appellant \" *needed a clearance\n> to go back to work as from monday 7.11.05 following R knee injury at work* \".\n> Dr Gak signed a certificate of sickness which recorded the appellant as\n> suffering from right knee injury. Dr Gak declared the appellant\n> fit to return to\n> work on Monday, 7 November 2005, which he did.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 22 | From about late 2006, the\n> appellant said that he needed to wear a knee guard or strapping at work. He wore\n> it on and off depending\n> on the level of his pain. As mentioned, this aspect of\n> the appellant's statement was corroborated by Mr Hyde.\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 23 | On 8 October 2007, because of\n> increasing pain in his right knee which the appellant said \" *just came on\n> after work* \", the appellant attended Grafton Base Hospital. He gave a\n> history to the Hospital of an injury \" *2 years ago while working timber mills*\". He stated that he had been walking a lot over the previous few days at\n> work and that the \" *pain started with swelling* \". He said he was unable\n> to bear weight on his right knee.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 24 | A CT scan performed on 10\n> October 2007 demonstrated a \" *hypodense mass* \" lying on \" *the lateral\n> aspect of the right knee* \". A letter from the Hospital of the same date to\n> Dr Barrell, the appellant's general practitioner, stated that having regard to\n> these\n> investigations, the diagnosis was highly likely to be a ganglion.\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 25 | In early 2008, Dr Barrell\n> referred the appellant to Dr Summersell.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 26 | The next relevant date is 22\n> January 2008. The appellant stated that whilst at work on that day, his leg pain\n> got progressively worse.\n> That afternoon at home, he assisted members of his\n> family to unload timber from a truck. He said that whilst he was undertaking\n> this\n> activity, his knee continued to swell and ache as it had during the day.\n> This was one of the activities upon which the respondent\n> relied as having caused\n> the appellant's disabilities.

One of the reasons for that rejection was because his\n> Honour considered that there was no persuasive medical support for\n> the\n> appellant's case. However, one of the reasons why the appellant's case did not\n> have any persuasive medical support was because\n> his Honour had rejected Dr\n> Summersell's opinion. His Honour rejected Dr Summersell's opinion because he had\n> not accepted the appellant's\n> case. With respect to his Honour, this reasoning\n> was circular.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 101 | It is not apparent to me\n> that had Dr Summersell's evidence been dealt with in accordance with correct\n> legal principle and had the\n> appellant been afforded procedural fairness in\n> respect of his Honour's dealing with Dr Summersell's evidence, that the result\n> would\n> have been the same. Had his Honour been directed to the correct\n> application of the principles which govern expert evidence, it may\n> have been\n> that weight would have been afforded to Dr Summersell's opinion.

It is apparent\n> that his Honour rejected Dr\n> Summersell's opinions due to his failure to deal with the non-work related\n> incidents (at [154]) and to\n> offer an explanation for the differences in his two\n> reports of 6 May 2008 (at [155]).  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 124 | Although the President\n> called *Makita* in aid of his conclusion that no weight should be accorded\n> to Dr Summersell's opinions, it is apparent that the President considered\n> that\n> those reports were, on their face and in the respects relied upon by him,\n> insufficient in the information they provided. His\n> Honour was alive to these\n> alleged deficiencies as appears from [153] of his reasons extracted at [54] of\n> Beazley JA's reasons,  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 125 | Of itself, in my respectful\n> opinion, this should have conveyed to his Honour a concern as to whether s\n> 354(6) of the WIM Act was satisfied\n> at the point where he was forming his\n> findings with respect to that material. It is apparent that the President did\n> not have sufficient\n> information upon which he could properly consider Dr\n> Summersell's reports of 6 May 2006 without further explanation from him as to\n> the differences between them. Given the submissions of the respondent\n> highlighted by Beazley JA at [104] of her reasons, and accepting\n> that the\n> President did not, at least expressly, adopt those submissions, nevertheless,\n> and particularly in the light of there being\n> no medical evidence tendered on\n> behalf of the respondent, fairness and justice required that Dr Summersell be\n> given the opportunity\n> of explaining the differences which ultimately caused the\n> President to reject his opinion.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 126 | I turn now to the findings\n> of the President referred to by Beazley JA at [52] of her reasons and, in\n> particular, to his Honour's finding\n> at [171] referred to by Beazley JA at [61]\n> above and which for convenience I repeat:  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> > \n> > \"The difficulty in accepting Mr Hancock's evidence of ongoing pain and\n> > instability in the knee since November 2005 is compounded\n> > by the overwhelming\n> > evidence of his friends and colleagues to the effect that he went for several\n> > years after his injury in March\n> > 2005 with no apparent restrictions, problems or\n> > complaints regarding his knee.

In particular,\n> he\n> considered that his evidence was inconsistent with that of his friends and work\n> colleagues who provided statements of which the\n> majority were those of the\n> respondent's employees and tendered by it: see at [168]-[169].\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 129 | There is no doubt that there\n> were apparent inconsistencies between the evidence of the appellant on the one\n> hand and those other witnesses\n> on the other. The President preferred the\n> evidence of the respondent's witnesses particularly because they were work\n> colleagues of\n> the appellant and some had become his friends and had not seen any\n> signs of any ongoing problems with the appellant's knee. At least\n> he had not\n> complained about it.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 130 | It is also clear from the\n> President's reasons at [160]-[173] that he regarded the appellant as lacking\n> credit. There can be no doubt\n> that in the mind of the President the evidence of\n> the lay witnesses raised questions with respect to the appellant's credit. Yet\n> it is apparent that his Honour still regarded it as appropriate to determine the\n> issue of credit \" *on the papers* \".  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 131 | As I have indicated,\n> Practice Direction No.1 makes clear that where an issue arises as to the credit\n> of an applicant or a witness,\n> that is a factor to be taken into account when\n> considering whether to determine a matter \" *on the papers* \". Whether or\n> not the President took that factor into account in determining the matter on the\n> papers is not apparent from his reasons.\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 132 | The assertion by the\n> President at [11] of his reasons, to which I have referred at [ REF\n> \\_Ref284861161 \\r \\h The President was aware\n> of the requirements of s 354(6) of\n> the WIM Act which he reproduced at [10] of his reasons. At [11] he said,\n> relevantly: ] above,\n> causes me some unease given that it must have been obvious\n> at an early point of his consideration of the statements of the various\n> witnesses that there was an issue with respect to the appellant's credit. One\n> might be forgiven for thinking that before an adverse\n> finding as to his credit\n> was made, the appellant should have been given the opportunity of answering or\n> explaining the evidence of\n> his work colleagues relied upon by the President that\n> he had not between 2005 and 2008 made complaints regarding his knee.\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 133 | Furthermore, it is not self\n> evident that the appellant was not still suffering the effects of the\n> work-related incident in the years\n> referred to simply because he did not\n> complain about his knee to the witnesses upon whose evidence the President\n> relied and who were\n> employees of the respondent whose statements were tendered\n> by it. There may have been a number of explanations for the lack of any\n> complaint. Thus the appellant may simply not have been a complainer. He may well\n> have not wished to complain about his knee to his\n> work colleagues in case it got\n> back to his employer and affected his job security. Thus, one of the statements\n> tendered on behalf\n> of the respondent was from the owner (and later manager) of\n> the respondent's business who stated that at no time in the two and a\n> half years\n> prior to the date of his statement (28 May 2008), had the appellant made any\n> mention of a work-related injury to his knee\n> or reported any such injury. Again,\n> the appellant may have simply preferred to work in a manner that did not reveal\n> any weakness\n> on his part in his ability to carry out his work to other employees\n> of the respondent. He may have preferred to work with undisclosed\n> pain rather\n> than seek compensation.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 134 | These are all considerations\n> which, in my respectful view, should have exercised the mind of the President\n> either before or during\n> his consideration of the matter so that he could be\n> satisfied immediately prior to making his final determination that he in fact\n> had sufficient information on which to make serious findings with respect to the\n> appellant's credit.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 135 | I have referred at [ REF\n> \\_Ref284861272 \\r \\h The Practice Direction also provides for the procedure for\n> determination of appeals on\n> the papers. It states: ] above to the statement in\n> Practice Direction No.1 as to the responsibility of the parties in ensuring that\n> comprehensive information is provided to the Presidential member. As I there\n> observed, failure of the parties to attend to their\n> responsibilities does not,\n> in my respectful view, relieve the Presidential member of his or her obligation\n> to be satisfied that he\n> or she has sufficient information to enable a\n> determination to be made without holding any conference or formal hearing. That\n> was\n> a continuing obligation and could not be avoided simply because the parties\n> had agreed that the appeal could be determined on the\n> papers.\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 136 | The present is a case where\n> the appellant was unsuccessful before the Commission because of unfulfilled gaps\n> and unexplained inconsistencies\n> in both in the appellant's evidence and that of\n> Dr Summersell's. The appellant's legal representatives should have been alive to\n> those gaps and inconsistencies and should have ensured that as far as\n> practicable the gaps were filled and the inconsistencies explained\n> by seeking to\n> file supplementary statements and/or reports. This should have occurred when the\n> matter was before the Arbitrator.\n> This is because an appeal under s 352 of the\n> WIM Act is by way of review of the decision appealed against rather than a\n> re-hearing:\n> see s 352(5). Nevertheless, pursuant to s 352(6) fresh or additional\n> evidence may be given on an appeal to the Commission with leave.\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 137 | Alternatively, a submission\n> could have been made on behalf of the appellant to the President that if the\n> credit of the appellant was\n> to be in issue, then fairness dictated that there\n> should be some form of hearing and that the matter should not be determined\n> solely\n> upon the papers.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 138 | This is not the first time\n> that I have commented upon the failure of legal representatives in cases such as\n> the present to ensure\n> that the evidentiary statements and reports which are to\n> be tendered and relied upon are comprehensive, complete and as consistent\n> as is\n> practicable. I adverted to this issue in *Brambles Industries Ltd v Bell* [[2010] NSWCA 162](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2010/162.html \"View Case\") at [[24]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2010/162.html#para24)- [[27]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2010/162.html#para27) with which McColl JA agreed.\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 139 | Obviously, we have not heard\n> from the appellant's legal representatives and, therefore, it would not be\n> appropriate to make any final\n> criticism of the manner in which they conducted\n> this matter. I am content to simply observe that a careful consideration of the\n> material\n> that was before the Arbitrator and which was to be before the President\n> revealed matters (such as the appellant's lack of complaints\n> to his work\n> colleagues) which, at least prima facie, would seem to have called for some\n> explanation from him in order to avoid any\n> adverse credit finding.\n>  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 140 | Be this as it may, the\n> President should have been alive to the matters to which I have referred given\n> that it was clear, at least\n> to him, that a significant issue in the appeal\n> involved the appellant's creditworthiness. Equally, again as the President\n> recognised,\n> the aspects of the two reports of Dr Summersell of 6 May 2008 upon\n> which he (the President) relied and which ultimately caused him\n> to give no\n> weight to that expert's opinion, involved an implicit finding which, at least in\n> part, reflected adversely on Dr Summersell's\n> credibility and integrity. As a\n> matter of fairness these problematic aspects of the reports called out for an\n> explanation particularly\n> in the light of the fact that no medical evidence was\n> tendered on behalf of the respondent. Dr Summersell was not, apparently, given\n> the opportunity to provide that explanation.  |\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> \n> |  |  |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | 141 | I simply conclude these\n> remarks by observing that the conduct of the appeal on the papers has left me\n> with a significant feeling of\n> unease.

The\nApplicant, referred to as DVF in these proceedings, is a ‘disqualified\nperson’ under [subsection 18(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caata2013326/s18.html) of the *Child Protection (Working with\nChildren) Act 2012* (NSW) (the Act) and seeks an enabling order pursuant to\nsection 28 of the Act declaring that he not be treated as a ‘disqualified\nperson’ so that he can be granted a Working with Children Check (WWCC)\nclearance.\n2. Due\nto the sensitive nature of these proceedings, an order was made, under\n[subsection 64(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caata2013326/s64.html) of the *[Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caata2013326/)* *2013*\n(NSW), that the name of the applicant and any child referred to in the evidence\nbefore the Tribunal and the name of any other person\nwhich would identify the\nname of the applicant or child referred to in the evidence, is not to be\npublished or broadcast without\nthe leave of the Tribunal.\n3. The\napplicant, who is 24 years of age, seeks a WWCC clearance because he wishes to\nseek guardianship of his 14 year old younger sibling,\nwho is currently under the\nguardianship of their grandmother. She is 78 years of age, has health problems\nand is no longer able to\nact as guardian for DVF’s brother. She has been\nrecently hospitalised and DVF has been caring for her.\n4. By\nnotice dated 22 March 2019 the applicant was informed by the respondent that he\nis a ‘disqualified person’ by reason\nof his conviction on 17 April\n2015 of six counts of having sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and\n16 years of age (contrary\nto section 66C(3) of the *Crimes Act 1990*(NSW)*,* and contravening an apprehended violence order (AVO). Offences\nunder section 66C (3) of the *Crimes Act 1990* (NSW) are disqualifying\noffences under the Act (Sch. 2 cl. 1(1)(h)).\n5. The\nvictim was 14 years old when she commenced a relationship with the applicant in\nJune 2014. In August 2014 the victim and the applicant\ncommenced a sexual\nrelationship. The applicant was 19 at this time. The applicant and the victim\nhad sexual intercourse at least\n3 times while she was 14 years of age and at\nleast 3 times when she was 15 years of age.\n6. The\nvictim became aware that she was pregnant in January 2015. The police were\ninformed and the victim provided a statement following\nwhich the applicant was\narrested on 29 January 2015. The applicant admitted the offence and was\nsubsequently served with an AVO protecting\nthe victim. He breached the AVO by\nhaving telephone contact with the victim and was remanded in custody on 10\nFebruary 2015.\n7. The\napplicant was also the subject of earlier allegations of sexual activity with\nyounger female children, however was never charged\nwith any offence.\n8. On\n17 April 2019 the applicant lodged an application for an enabling order from the\nTribunal pursuant to section 28 of the Act.\n9. In\nwritten submissions lodged on 22 August 2019, the respondent neither consented\nto nor opposed the application made by DVF. At the\nconclusion of oral evidence\nand prior to the Tribunal determining the matter, the respondent revised her\nview and supported DVF’s\napplication for an enabling\norder.\n\n**The Legislative Scheme**\n\n\n1. The\nAct makes provision for the regulation of those persons who engage in or\ncontinue to engage in ‘child related work’.\nThe objects of the Act\nare to protect children:\n\t* (a) by not\n\tpermitting certain persons to engage in child-related work; and\n\t* (b) by\n\trequiring persons engaged in child related work to have working with children\n\tcheck clearances.\n2. Section\n4 of the Act provides that the ‘safety, welfare and well-being of children\nand, in particular, protecting them from\nchild abuse, is the paramount\nconsideration’ in the operation of the Act.\n3. It\nfollows that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is protective and not punitive in\nnature: see *Commissioner for Children and Young People v FZ*  [[2011] NSWCA\n11](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2011/11.html \"View Case\") per Young JA at [61]. That is, the object of the Act is not to impose\nadditional punishment on a disqualified person but to eliminate\npossible risks\nto the safety of children. ‘Children’ is defined in subsection 5(1)\nof the Act to mean persons under the\nage of 18 years of age. It follows that the\nword ‘child’ has the same meaning.\n4. Subsection\n8(1) of the Act prohibits a person from engaging in ‘child related\nwork’ unless (a) the person holds the relevant\nWWCC clearance or (b) there\nis a current application, by the person, to the Children’s Guardian for\nthe relevant WWCC clearance.\n5. Subsection\n9(1) of the Act contains a similar prohibition on an employer employing or\ncontinuing to employ a person in child-related\nwork who does not hold or have a\ncurrent application for a relevant WWCC clearance.\n6. Child-related\nwork is broadly defined in sections 6 and 7of the Act. It includes paid and\nunpaid child-related work.\n7. Applications\nfor a WWCC clearance are made to the respondent under section 13 of the Act.\nSection 18 sets out the powers of the respondent\nin regard to determining any\napplication that is made. As we have noted the respondent refused DVF’s\napplication, as she was\nrequired to do under subsection 18(1) of the Act,\nbecause he is a disqualified person having been convicted of a Schedule 2\ndisqualifying\noffence.\n8. Subsection\n28(1) of the Act gives the Tribunal a discretion, on the application of a\ndisqualified person, to make an enabling order\ndeclaring the person not to be\ntreated as a disqualified person for the purposes of the Act in respect of the\ndisqualifying offence.\n9. Subsection\n28(7) provides that where an application for an enabling order is\nsought:\n\n\n> \n> “...it is to be presumed, unless the applicant proves to the contrary,\n> that the applicant poses a risk to the safety of\n> children”.\n\n1. In\nthis application, therefore, the onus is on the applicant to rebut this\nstatutory presumption that he poses a risk to the safety\nof children.\n2. The\nmeaning of the word ‘risk’ was considered by Young CJ (in Equity) in\n*Commission for Children and Young People v V*  [[2002] NSWSC 949](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/949.html \"View Case\"); [56 NSWLR\n476](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=56%20NSWLR%20476 \"View LawCiteRecord\") at [[42]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/949.html#para42). That consideration was made in the context of section 9(4) of the\nformer *[Child Protection (Prohibited Employment) Act 1998](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/)*. At [42], his\nHonour said:\n\n\n> \n> One does not define risk as meaning minimal risk. One would... exclude fanciful\n> or theoretical risk but what one is looking for is\n> whether, in all the\n> circumstances, there is a real and appreciable risk in the sense of a risk that\n> is greater than the risk of any\n> adult preying on a child. One, however, must\n> link the word ‘risk’ with the words that follow, namely ‘to\n> the safety\n> of children’...\n\n1. The\nTribunal has adopted a similar meaning to the word “risk” as it\nappears in the current Act.\n2. Subsection\n28(8) provides that an enabling order cannot be made subject to conditions. That\nis, if an enabling order is made and a\nWWCC clearance is granted this clears the\nperson to work in all forms of child-related work for five years unless\nsuspended or cancelled\nby the respondent prior thereto.\n\n**The\nevidence relied upon**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant relied upon the following documentary material:\n\t* (a) Application\n\tfor review filed 17 April 2019 attaching the Notice of Disqualified Person\n\t(Exhibit A1); and\n\t* (b) Bundle of 3\n\tcharacter references filed 6 August 2019 (Exhibit A2).\n2. The\nrespondent relied upon the following documentary material:\n\t* (a) Respondent’s\n\tsubmissions on final hearing filed 22 August 2019 (for convenience referred to\n\tas Exhibit R1);\n\t* (b) First\n\tVolume of Evidence Relied upon by the Respondent filed 6 June 2019 and 10\n\tSeptember 2019 (Exhibit R2);\n\t* (c) Second\n\tVolume of Evidence Relied upon by the Respondent filed 4 July 2019 (Exhibit\n\tR3);\n\t* (d) Third\n\tVolume of Evidence Relied upon by the Respondent filed 12 July 2019 (Exhibit\n\tR4);\n\t* (e) Fourth\n\tVolume of Evidence Relied upon by the Respondent filed 8 August 2019 (Exhibit\n\tR5).\n\n**The evidence presented**\n\n\n1. The\nTribunal \"*must consider*\" those factors set out in section 30(1) in\ndetermining an application under Part 4 of the Act, which includes this\napplication. These\nare similar to those taken into account by the Children's\nGuardian under section 15 (4) of the Act for the purposes of carrying out\ntheir\nrisk assessment.\n2. The\nTribunal must also satisfy itself in relation to the tests set out in section\n30(1A) of the Act.\n3. The\nevidence is set out below under subheadings that refer to the section 30(1)\nfactors and section 30(1A) tests set out in the Act.\n\n**Section 30\n(1) factors**\n\n\n**(a) The seriousness of the offences**\n\n\n1. On\n17 April 2015 the applicant pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, six counts\nof having sexual intercourse with a child between\n14 and 16 years of age\n(contrary to section 66C(3) of the *Crimes Act 1990,* and contravening an\napprehended violence order (AVO). Offences under this section of the *Crimes\nAct 1990* are disqualifying offences under the Act (Sch. 2 cl. 1(1)(h)).\n2. In\nrelation to the sexual offences the applicant was sentenced to 18 months\nimprisonment which was suspended under section 12 of the\n*[Crimes (Sentencing\nProcedure) Act 1999](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1999278/).* He was placed on a good behaviour bond for 18 months\nfrom 17 April 2015. In relation to the contravention of the AVO the applicant\nreceived a [section 9](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1999278/s9.html) bond of 18 months.\n3. On\n7 February 2018 the applicant was convicted of failing to comply with his\nreporting obligations under [section 17(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpra2000403/s17.html) of the *[Child Protection (Offenders\nRegistration) Act 2000](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpra2000403/),* having failed to inform the NSW Police that he had\nchanged his mobile phone number. He was placed on a good behaviour bond for 2\nyears pursuant to [section 9(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1999278/s9.html) of the *[Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1999278/)*1999.\n4. The\napplicant had just turned 19 years of age at the time of the sexual offences and\nwas in a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship with\nthe victim who was 14 years of\nage when the first offence took place and 15 years of age at the time of the\nlast offence.\n5. The\nrespondent submits in written submissions (R1, page 6) that the disqualifying\noffences are objectively serious, carrying a maximum\npenalty of 10 years’\nimprisonment. The respondent also submits that all sexual offences against\nchildren are serious, but notes\nthat although the sentencing Magistrate\nconsidered the offences to be serious, he imposed a suspended term of\nimprisonment, taking\ninto account the applicant’s plea of guilty, the\nperiod he had spent on remand, his prior good character, positive references\nand\nhis difficult upbringing.\n6. The\nrespondent acknowledges the applicant’s difficult upbringing, which\nincluded exposure to physical violence, drug abuse,\nthe death of his father and\nbeing removed from his mother’s care by Family and Community\nServices.\n7. The\napplicant stated under cross-examination that he was aware that having sexual\nintercourse with a child under the age of 16 years\nwas against the law but that\nit happened because ‘we fell in love’. He stated that ‘I did\nthe wrong thing but I\ncouldn’t help it’. DVF said that ‘I was\nimmature, stupid and young’ but ‘I wouldn’t take it back\nbecause I have two lovely children and a strong relationship’ (with the\nvictim).\n8. The\napplicant also told us about his difficult upbringing. He has eight siblings and\ntwo half-siblings and, as the oldest child, undertook\nthe duties as the main\ncarer for the younger children. He was subjected to serious physical punishment\nby his father and witnessed\ndomestic violence and drug use by his parents. While\nstill a child the applicant found his father’s body after he had\nsuicided.\n9. During\nthe hearing the applicant gave evidence that he now understands the potentially\nharmful effect of an adult having sexual intercourse\nwith a 14 year old and\nthat, if he became aware of such an incident taking place, he would ‘go to\nthe Police’.\n\n**(b) The period of time since those matters\noccurred and the conduct of the person since they occurred**\n\n\n1. The\ndisqualifying offences took place approximately four years ago between August\nand November 2014.\n2. Since\nthat time the applicant has had one further criminal conviction for failing to\ncomply with his obligations under the *[Child Protection (Offenders\nRegistration) Act 2000](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpra2000403/).*\n3. The\napplicant told us that this conviction occurred because he forgot to inform the\nPolice that he had changed his mobile phone number.\nThe Police reached him on\nhis landline and charged him because the mobile phone number they tried to reach\nhim on had been disconnected.\n4. Since\nthe disqualifying offences the applicant has run his own business as a qualified\nplasterer and more recently has been caring\nfulltime for his aging\ngrandmother.\n5. DVF\nand the victim resumed their relationship once the AVO was ended and the victim\nreached 16 years of age. They have since had a\nsecond child and are engaged to\nbe married. DVF’s fiancée attended the hearing and supported\nDVF.\n6. DVF\ntold us that the victim’s father threatened he would go to the Police\nunless the victim had an abortion. She did not want\nan abortion and therefore\nher father went to the Police. DVF stated that he now has a good relationship\nwith the victim’s father,\nwho lived with him for 10 months and against\nwhom he ‘bears no grudge’. The victim confirmed that DVF and her\nfather\nnow have a positive relationship.\n\n**(c) The age of the\nperson at the time the offences or matters occurred**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant was 19 years of age at the time of the disqualifying\noffences.\n\n**(d) The age of each victim of any relevant offence or\nconduct at the time they occurred and any matters relating to the vulnerability\nof the victim**\n\n\n1. The\nvictim was 14 years old at the time of the first disqualifying offence and was\n15 years old at the time of the last offence. Apart\nfrom the victim’s age,\nthere is no evidence of her being vulnerable for any other\nreason.\n\n**(e) The difference in age between the victim and the\nperson and the relationship (if any) between the victim and the person**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant was approximately 4 years older than the victim. The applicant asserts\nthat he lacked maturity at the time.\n2. The\napplicant and the victim were in a boyfriend/girlfriend\nrelationship.\n\n**(f) Whether the person knew, or could reasonably\nhave known, that the victim was a child**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant acknowledges that he was aware of the complainant’s\nage.\n\n**(g) The person’s present age**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant is now 24 years of age.\n\n**(h) The seriousness of the\nperson’s total criminal record and the conduct of the person since the\noffences occurred**\n\n\n1. Other\nthan the disqualifying offences and the breach of the AVO, the applicant has\nbeen convicted for failing to comply with his reporting\nobligations under the\n*[Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpra2000403/)* as outlined above.He received a [section 9](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpra2000403/s9.html) bond for a period of 2 years from 7 February 2018\nfor this offence.\n\n**(i) The likelihood of any repetition by the\nperson of the offences or conduct and the impact on children of any such\nrepetition**\n\n\n1. The\nrespondent sets out in Exhibit R1 at page 8 a summary of the pre-sentencing\nreport and consultation with a forensic psychologist\nconducted on 14 April 2015.\nIt is stated that the report writer notes that the\napplicant:\n\n\n> \n> ... appeared to demonstrate limited insight into his offending behaviour and\n> maintained that he was in a committed relationship with\n> the victim. However he\n> acknowledged he was aware his behaviour was wrong and conceded that he should\n> not have commenced sexual relations\n> with the victim at that stage of the\n> relationship.\n\n1. It\nis noted that the applicant was assessed as being at medium/low risk of\nre-offending but that he:\n\n\n> \n> ...did not display evidence of any of the major dynamic risk factors for sexual\n> reoffending and that his main treatment needs were\n> in relation to possible PTSD\n> (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder)\n\nClinical psychological\nintervention was recommended.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant told us that he was an angry child as a result of his upbringing and\nthat he realised when he was about 17 years of\nage that he became violent as a\nresult of smoking cannabis and decided to stop this behaviour.\n2. The\napplicant was asked under cross-examination about an incident in 2013 when he\nwas alleged to have been involved in sexual activity\nwith a 14 year old girl and\nto have been warned by police that sexual activity with children under the age\nof 16 years is prohibited.\nThe applicant stated he had no recollection of\nthis.\n3. During\nthe hearing the applicant told us that he saw a psychologist approximately once\nper fortnight for a period of six to seven\nmonths after his conviction to\ndiscuss his treatment as a child and to develop strategies to manage his anger.\nHe stated that if\nhe was experiencing difficulty he would seek help again in the\nfuture. The applicant told us that he now rarely experiences anger\nand is more\nprone to becoming upset when confronted by challenging situations.\n4. This\nwas confirmed by the victim who told us that the applicant has always treated\nher well and that from the beginning of their relationship\nthey ‘just got\nalong great’. She said that they initially engaged in social activities\nsuch as going to the movies and\nthat their sexual relationship was only a minor\npart of their relationship when she was a child. She spoke positively of\nDVF’s\nrelationship with their children and told us that she has never\nobserved any behaviours of concern. She said that ‘we were\nvery stupid but\nI have no regrets’.\n\n**(j) Any information given by the\napplicant in, or in relation to, the application**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant provided three written character references.\n2. One\nof his referees gave oral evidence. This witness told us that he is an\nexperienced foster carer who currently cares for two of\nthe applicant’s\nsiblings who are aged 8 and 12 years. He has made efforts to reunite the\nchildren in his care with their other\nsiblings, including the applicant, with\nwhom he has regular contact. He stated that the applicant is kind and attentive\ntowards his\nchildren and his siblings and that he has no concerns about his\nparenting skills. The witness endeavours to provide a positive role\nmodel to the\napplicant. He has also recommended that the applicant would be suitable to\nprovide respite care for those of his siblings\ncurrently cared for by the\nwitness, with whom the applicant has now developed a strong\nrelationship.\n\n**(k) Any relevant information in relation to the\nperson that was obtained in accordance with section 36A of the Act**\n\n\n1. There\nis no such information\n\n**(i) Any other matters that the\nChildren’s Guardian considers necessary**\n\n\n1. The\nChildren’s Guardian does not consider any other matters necessary for\nconsideration.\n\n*Section 30(1A) tests*\n\n\n1. In\nthe written submission the Children’s Guardian ‘maintains a neutral\nposition’ as to whether the reasonable person\nand public interest tests in\nsection 30(1A) have been satisfied.\n2. Prior\nto us making a determination, however, the Children’s Guardian stated at\nthe hearing that they supported the applications\nmade by DVF and are satisfied\nthat the section 30(1A) tests have been\nsatisfied.\n\n**Consideration**\n\n\n1. As\npreviously noted, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the Act is protective,\nnot punitive. The Act requires that the protection\nof children, particularly\nfrom child abuse, is the paramount consideration of the Tribunal.\n2. Although\nthe offences committed by the applicant are serious, the Tribunal accepts that\nthe behaviour that took place and triggered\nthese proceedings is at the lower\nend of seriousness in relation to disqualifying offences and a reasonable period\nof time has passed\nsince the offences were committed.\n3. We\naccept the applicant’s written evidence that at the time he committed the\nevidence he lacked maturity and that he understands\nthat his behaviour was wrong\nand that a child is unable to provide consent to sexual activity.\n4. We\nnote the view of the psychologist who conducted a forensic assessment of the\napplicant regarding his risk of sexual reoffending\nand related treatment needs\nprior to his sentencing hearing in 2015 (Exhibit R2 pages 223-226). She\nconcluded that the applicant’s:\n\n\n> \n> ... main treatment needs are in relation to possible PTSD following the trauma\n> of finding his father’s body...\n\nand that,\n\n\n\n> \n> ...his risk would best be managed through clinical psychological intervention,\n> rather than within a specific sex offender treatment\n> programme.\n\n1. We\naccepted the applicant’s evidence that he saw a psychologist regularly for\na period of approximately 26 weeks to address\nthe traumatic events of his\nchildhood and that he would seek assistance again if he felt it to be\nnecessary.\n2. Subsection\n28(5) of the Act provides that the applicant is required to fully disclose to\nthe Tribunal any matters relevant to his\napplication and there is no suggestion\nthat the applicant has been other than open and frank and has willingly\ndisclosed all relevant\nmatters. The applicant presents as a young man who has\novercome significant adversity in life and who has matured a great deal since\ncommitting the disqualifying offences.\n3. We\naccepted the evidence of the victim, who is now engaged to be married to the\napplicant, that she has no concerns about the applicant’s\nbehaviour in\nrelation to children and that although she was not old enough to provide\ninformed consent, she was not coerced into\nhaving sex with him.\n4. We\naccepted the positive references provided, particularly the oral evidence of the\nreferee who has a close and ongoing relationship\nwith the applicant and the\napplicant’s siblings. This is in the applicant’s favour.\n5. We\nare satisfied that a reasonable person with knowledge of the particulars of the\noffences committed by the applicant and the surrounding\nfacts would allow his or\nher children to have direct contact with the applicant in situations where he is\nnot directly supervised\nby another person while engaged in child-related work\n(the test under section (30)(1A)(a)).\n6. We\nare also satisfied that it is in the public interest for the Tribunal to grant\nan enabling order (the test under section (30)(1A)(b)).\nWe note that the\napplicant wishes to be able to assume responsibility for the guardianship of his\n14 year old sibling given his grandmother’s\nfailing health, and to be able\nto provide respite care for some of his other siblings. This is in the public\ninterest.\n7. We\nare satisfied that on the balance of probabilities the evidence does not\nestablish that the applicant poses a real and appreciable\nrisk of harm to\nchildren.\n8.

The\napplicant BKO, seeks review of the decision of the respondent, the\nChildren’s Guardian, to refuse his application for a\nworking with children\ncheck clearance, under the Child Protection (Working with Children) Act 2012\n(“the Act”).\n2. The\napplicant is 32 years of age and is a personal fitness trainer. He seeks a\nworking with children check clearance to enable him\nto gain further employment\nin the fitness industry, including in gymnasiums that require staff to hold\nworking with children check\nclearances.\n3. On\n9 July 2013, the applicant applied to the respondent for a working with children\ncheck clearance. The applicant’s criminal\nconvictions for offences of\nviolence caused the respondent to conduct a risk assessment under section 14 and\n15 of the Act.\n4. Having\ncompleted the risk assessment, on 19 June 2014, the Children’s Guardian\nmade a decision to refuse to grant the applicant\na working with children check\nclearance under subsection 18(2) of the Act. The risk assessment highlighted the\nfollowing concerns:\n\t* Anti-social\n\tattitudes and beliefs that support aggression and violence;\n\t* Likelihood of\n\tphysical aggression in response to disrespect as a possible risk to\n\tchildren\n\t* Risk of relapse\n\tand using violence to attain money for drugs;\n\t* Lack of time\n\tsince offending;\n\t* Lack of evidence\n\tto demonstrate that the applicant has addressed successfully his violent\n\tbehaviour, drug misuse and ability to cope\n\tin stressful situations in a\n\tnon-violent manner.\n5. On\n14 July 2014 the applicant applied to the Tribunal for review of the\nrespondent’s decision pursuant to section 27 of the\n*Child Protection\n(Working with Children) Act 2012* (‘the Act’). Additionally, the\napplicant applied for a stay of the decision of the Children’s Guardian,\nwhich was\nsubsequently withdrawn and dismissed on 31 July 2014. On that\noccasion, the Tribunal made directions as to the filing and service\nof documents\nby the respondent and the applicant. The matter was listed for hearing on 16\nOctober 2014. However, it was adjourned,\nas the applicant had not filed\ndocumentary evidence in support of his application. The matter was re-listed for\nhearing on 27 March\n2015. It proceeded on that date, and was adjourned to 28\nApril 2015 for further hearing and to enable a psychologist to attend for\ncross\nexamination.\n\n**The Role of the Tribunal**\n\n\n1. There\nis no dispute the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine the\napplicant’s application: see section 27 of the Act,\nsection 30 of the\nCivil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 and section 9 of the Administrative\nDecisions Review Act 1997.\n2. The\nissue to be decided by the Tribunal is what the correct and preferable decision\nis having regard to the material before the Tribunal\nin relation to the granting\nof a working with children check clearance in relation to the applicant: (see\nsection 63 *Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997.)*\n3. That\nis, the Tribunal sits in the shoes of the decision maker and decides the matter\nafresh, as at the date of hearing: see *YG and GG v Minister for Community\nServices*  [[2002] NSWCA 247](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2002/247.html \"View Case\"), at [25].\n4. In\ndetermining this application, the Tribunal has power to make the following\norders:\n\n\n> \n> **63 Determination of administrative review by\n> Tribunal**  \n>   \n> \n> (1) ...  \n>   \n> \n> (2) ...  \n>   \n> \n> (3) In determining an application for the administrative review of an\n> administratively reviewable decision, the Tribunal may decide:\n\n\n\n> \n> > (a) to affirm the administratively reviewable\n> > decision, or  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (b) to vary the administratively reviewable decision, or  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (c) to set aside the administratively reviewable decision and make a\n> > decision in substitution for the administratively reviewable\n> > decision it set\n> > aside, or  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (d) to set aside the administratively reviewable decision and remit\n> > the matter for reconsideration by the administrator in accordance\n> > with any\n> > directions or recommendations of the Tribunal.\n> \n> \n\n\n**The working with children legislative scheme**\n\n\n1. The\nobject of the Act is to protect children\nby not permitting disqualified persons, without clearances, to engage in child-related\nwork,\nand by requiring persons engaged in child-related\nwork\nto have working\nwith children check clearances.\n(See section 3 of the\nAct).\n2. The\nsafety, welfare and well being of children\nand, in particular, protecting them from child abuse, is the paramount\nconsideration\nin the operation of the Act. (See section 4 of the Act).\n3. Section\n8(1) of the Act prohibits a person from engaging in child-related work, unless\nthe person holds the relevant working with\nchildren check clearance or there is\na current application by the person to the Children’s Guardian for the\nrelevant working\nwith children check clearance. A breach of section 8(1) is an\noffence.\n4. The\ndefinition of “*child related work*” includes a\n“*worker engaged in work in a child related role*.” (See\nsection 6(1) of the Act).\n5. Section\n6(2) of the Act provides that the work referred to for the purpose of section\n6(1)(a), is work for, or in connection with\nany of the activities, as listed in\nsection 6(2)(a) to (m), and which are declared by the regulations, to be child\nrelated work.\n6. Direct\ncontact with children is defined in subsection 6(4) to mean physical\ncontact, or face to face contact. Where a person is granted\na working with\nchildren check clearance, that clearance authorises the person to work in any\nchild-related work prescribed under\nthe Act or the *Child Protection (Working\nwith Children) Regulation* 2013.\n7. Part\n3 of the Act deals with working with children clearances. That Part is divided\ninto 6 Divisions as follows:\n\t* (1) Division 1\n\tsets out the classes of clearance. There are essentially two classes of\n\tclearance, a volunteer clearance authorising\n\ta person to engage in unpaid\n\tchild-related work and a non-volunteer clearance authorising a person to engage\n\tin paid and unpaid child-related\n\twork: (See section 12 of the Act)\n\t* (2) Division 2\n\tdeals with applications for clearances: (See section 13 of the Act) Such\n\tapplications are made to the Children's Guardian;\n\t* (3) Division 3\n\tdeals with risk assessment of persons who have made an application for a\n\tclearance or who are holders of a clearance;\n\t\t+ (i) Section\n\t\t15(1) provides that the Children’s Guardian must conduct a risk assessment\n\t\tof an applicant for a working with children\n\t\tcheck clearance to determine whether\n\t\tthe applicant poses a risk to the safety of children.\n\t* (4) Division 4\n\tdeals with determinations by the Children's Guardian, of applications for\n\tclearance;\n\t* (5) Division 5\n\tdeals with the duration of a clearance (5 years) and the circumstances in which\n\ta clearance can be cancelled: (See\n\tsections 22 to 24);\n\t* (6) Division 6\n\t- establishes the working with children register.\n8. Section\n18(1) of the Act provides that the Children's Guardian must not grant a working\nwith children check clearance to a 'disqualified\nperson'. (Broadly these include\npersons convicted of an offence, committed as an adult and specified in Schedule\n2 of the Act.)\n9. Section\n18(2) provides that the Children’s Guardian must grant a clearance to a\nperson who is subject to a risk assessment under\nDivision 3 unless the\nChildren’s Guardian is satisfied that the person poses a risk to the\nsafety of children.\n10. The\nword 'conviction' is defined in section 5(1) to include 'a finding that the\ncharge for an offence is proven, or that a person\nis guilty of an offence, even\nthough the court does not proceed to conviction.'\n11. Part\n4 of the Act deals with reviews and appeals. Section 27 makes provision for\nadministrative review, by the NSW Civil and Administrative\nTribunal, of\ndecisions of the Children's Guardian, including a refusal to provide a working\nwith children check clearance.\n\t* (i) 27\n\tApplications to Civil and Administrative Tribunal\n\tfor administrative reviews of clearance\n\tdecisions\n\n\n\n> \n> > \n> > > (1) A person who has been refused a working\n> > > with children check clearance\n> > > by the Children’s\n> > > Guardian may apply to the Tribunal\n> > > for an administrative review under the AdministrativeDecisions\n> > > Review Act 1997of the decision within 28 days after notice of the decision was given to the\n> > > person.  \n> > >   \n> > > \n> > > (2) A person whose clearance\n> > > is cancelled by the Children’s\n> > > Guardian may apply to the Tribunal\n> > > for an administrative review\n> > > under the Administrative\n> > > Decisions Review Act1997of the decision within 28 days after notice of the decision was given to the\n> > > person.  \n> > >   \n> > > \n> > > (3) A person who is subject to an interim\n> > > bar\n> > > imposed by the Children’s\n> > > Guardian may apply to the Tribunal\n> > > for an administrative\n> > > review under the Administrative\n> > > Decisions ReviewAct\n> > > 1997of the decision, but only if the interim\n> > > bar\n> > > has been in force for more than 6 months.  \n> > >   \n> > > \n> > > (4) An applicant must fully disclose to the Tribunal\n> > > any matters relevant to the application.\n> > \n> > \n> \n> \n\n\n1. Section\n30 sets out how an application under Part 4 of the Act is to be determined by\nthe Tribunal. It is in the following terms:\n\n\n> \n> (i) 30 Determination of applications and other matters  \n>   \n> \n> (1) The Tribunal\n> must consider the following in determining an application under this Part:  \n>   \n> \n> (a) the seriousness of the offences with respect to which the person is a disqualified\n> person\n> or any matters that caused a refusal\n> of a clearance\n> or imposition of an interim\n> bar,  \n>   \n> \n> (b) the period of time since those offences or matters occurred and the conduct\n> of the person since they occurred,  \n>   \n> \n> (c )the age of the person at the time the offences or matters occurred,  \n>   \n> \n> (d) the age of each victim of any relevant offence or conduct at the time they\n> occurred and any matters relating to the vulnerability\n> of the victim,  \n>   \n> \n> (e) the difference in age between the victim and the person and the relationship\n> (if any) between the victim and the person,  \n>   \n> \n> (f) whether the person knew, or could reasonably have known, that the victim was\n> a child,  \n>   \n> \n> (g) the person’s present age,  \n>   \n> \n> (h) the seriousness of the person’s total criminal record and the conduct\n> of the person since the offences occurred,  \n>   \n> \n> (i) the likelihood of any repetition by the person of the offences or conduct\n> and the impact on children\n> of any such repetition,  \n>   \n> \n> (j) any information given by the applicant in, or in relation to, the\n> application,  \n>   \n> \n> (k) any other matters that the Children’s\n> Guardian considers necessary.\n\n1. In\ndetermining the application under s 27 of the Act the Tribunal is to decide what\nthe correct and preferable decision, having regard\nto all the material before\nit, including material which may not have been before the Children’s\nGuardian. (See s 63 *Administrative Review Act 1997)*\n\n**The\nrelevant legal principles**\n\n\n*The Trigger for the risk assessment*\n\n\n1. The\ntrigger for the risk assessment is the applicant’s convictions for\noffences of violence considered sufficient to indicate\na pattern of behaviour\nthat warrants investigation as to whether it may cause a risk to the safety of\nchildren pursuant to clause\n1(1)(6) of Schedule 1.\n2. Section\n14 of the Act requires a risk assessment if any of the matters specified in\nSchedule 1 of the Act apply.\n\n**Nature of the proceedings**\n\n\n1. The\njurisdiction of the Tribunal under section 27 of the Act is protective and not\npunitive in nature: *BJB v Office of the Children’s Guardian* [[2014]\nNSWCATAD 111](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/111.html \"View Case\") at [[110]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/111.html#para110) *AYU v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian* [[2014]\nNSWCATAD 69](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/69.html \"View Case\"), at [34]; *Commission for Children and Young People v FZ* [[2011] NSWCA\n111](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2011/111.html \"View Case\"), per\nYoung JA at [61] and *R v Commission for Children and Young People* [[2002]\nNSWIRComm 101](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWIRComm/2002/101.html \"View Case\")\nat [[130]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWIRComm/2002/101.html#para130)\n\n**Burden\nof Proof**\n\n\n1. The\nAct is silent as to where the onus lies in relation to an application for\nadministrative review under Part 4 of the Act. It has\nbeen held that neither\nparty bears an onus of proof in relation to an application under section 27 of\nthe Act; *BJB v The Children’s Guardian (No. 2) [[2014] NSWCATAD 164](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/164.html \"View Case\")*\nat [[32]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/164.html#para32).\n2. An\napplication pursuant to section 27 is a merits review and not a review in which\nthe applicant must show that the decision maker\nwas wrong: *Re Control\nInvestments Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (No. 2) [(1981) 3 ALD\n88](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%203%20ALD%2088 \"View LawCiteRecord\")*.\n3. There\nis no presumption that the applicant poses a risk to children as there would be\nif the applicant were a disqualified person\nseeking an enabling order pursuant\nto s28 of the Act.\n4. The\napplicant has a duty to disclose all relevant material. (See section 27(4))\n5. Although\nthe applicant has no legal burden he does have a practical or forensic onus\n(*Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v QAAH of\n2004 [[2006] HCA 53](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2006/53.html \"View Case\")*) and the Tribunal has to consider all of the evidence\nadduced by the parties in light of and under the mandated considerations\ncontained\nin section 30 of the Act.\n\n**Risk to the safety of\nchildren**\n\n\n1. In\nthis application, an issue for determination is whether the applicant, on the\nbalance of probabilities, poses a risk to the safety\nof children. The Tribunal\nmust have regard to the matters contained in section 15(4) and section 30(1) of\nthe Act in deciding this\nissue.\n2. The\nmeaning of the word 'risk' was considered by Young CJ (in Equity) in\n*Commission for Children and Young People v V* [[2002] NSWSC\n949](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/949.html \"View Case\")*;* [56\nNSWLR 476](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=56%20NSWLR%20476 \"View LawCiteRecord\"), at\n[42]. His Honour's consideration was made in the context of section 9(4) of the\nformer [Child\nProtection (Prohibited Employment) Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/) \n(‘the Repealed Act’.) At [42], His Honour\nsaid:\n\n\n> \n> '42 One does not define risk as meaning minimal risk. One would ...exclude\n> fanciful or theoretical risk but what one is looking for\n> is whether, in all the\n> circumstances, there is a real and appreciable risk in the sense of a risk that\n> is greater than the risk of\n> any adult preying on a child. One, however, must\n> link the word \"risk\" with the words that follow, namely, \"to the safety of\n> children\".\n> ...'\n\n1. These\nremarks of His Honour have continued to be cited with approval, by the\nAdministrative Decisions Tribunal, in construing the\nmeaning of 'risk' as it\nappeared in section 33J(1) of the repealed Part\n7\nof the [Commission\nfor Children and Young People Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) :\nsee *ADV v Commission for Children and Young People*  [[2012] NSWADT\n8](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2012/8.html \"View Case\")\nand *RD v Commissioner NSW Commission for Children and Young People* [[2011] NSWADT\n140](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2011/140.html \"View Case\") at [[10]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2011/140.html#para10).\n2. The\nremarks have also been cited with approval in *AYU v NSW Office of the\nChildren’s Guardian* [[2014] NSWCATAD 69](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/69.html \"View Case\"), *BFC v The Children’s\nGuardian*  [[2014] NSWCATAD 90](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/90.html \"View Case\"), *BFX v Children’s Guardian*  [[2014]\nNSWCATAD 115](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/115.html \"View Case\") and also in BJB v NSW Office of the Children’s Guardian (No\n2) 2014 NSWCAT 164 at [33].\n\n**The Issue**\n\n\n1. The\nprimary issue before the Tribunal in this application, is what the correct and\npreferable decision is having regard to the material\nbefore the Tribunal in\nrelation to the granting of a working with children check clearance in relation\nto the applicant: section\n63 *Administrative Decisions Review Act\n1997.*\n\n**The Evidence before the Tribunal**\n\n\n1. The\nrespondent tendered into evidence its correspondence with the applicant, its\nrisk assessment report dated 11 April 2014 and attachments,\nincluding documents\nprovided by Corrective Services, Court records, urinalysis reports, and\npsychological risk assessment reports.\n2. The\napplicant relied upon a statutory declaration dated 28 November 2014, references\nby Mr Shane Brown, Senior Counsellor at Weave\nYouth and Community Services, Ms\nBonwick, Co-ordinator, Key College - Father Chris Riley’s Youth Off the\nStreets, and psychological\nreports of Mr Kevin O’Sullivan and Mr York Hong\nof the Wentworth Forensic Clinic.\n3. The\napplicant was not legally represented during the Tribunal proceedings. He was\nassisted by his friend, Ms K, who sat at the bar\ntable for the majority of the\nproceedings. This was permitted by the Tribunal and was not objected to by the\nrespondent.\n4. The\napplicant gave oral evidence at the hearing and was cross-examined by counsel\nfor the respondent. Ms Anita McGregor, Psychologist,\nalso gave evidence and was\ncross-examined.\n\n**Seriousness of the matters that caused an\nassessment and a refusal of a clearance or imposition of an interim bar**\n\n\n1. According\nto the respondent’s risk assessment report, the offences which triggered\nthe respondent’s risk assessment were\nthe offences of violence as\nfollows:\n\t* (1) 25 January\n\t2002: Assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The applicant was sentenced\n\tto 6 months’ imprisonment (and was sentenced for other non-trigger\n\toffences at the same time).\n\t* (2) 22 February\n\t2002: Robbery In Company. The applicant was sentenced to four years\n\timprisonment with a non-parole period of two years.\n\t* (3) 18 November\n\t2010: Aggravated Armed Robbery, Possess Loaded Firearm in a Public Place\n\tand Possess Unregistered Firearm. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment\n\tfor a total\n\tof five years and three months, with a non-parole period of two\n\tyears and nine months.\n2. While\nnot specifically identified in the respondent’s risk assessment, the\napplicant was also convicted of other offences of\nviolence, however, such\noffences were committed when the applicant was a juvenile,\nnamely:\n\t* (1) 13 January\n\t1999: Resist Officer in Execution of Duty, Assault Officer in Execution of Duty\n\t(2 counts). The applicant was sentenced\n\tto 24 months’ probation, under the\n\tsupervision of the Juvenile Justice Branch, and to attend counselling.\n\t* (2) 14 December\n\t2000: Aggravated Robbery. On sentence for this offence, the applicant was\n\tordered to perform 50 hours of community\n\tservice.\n\n**Facts\nof the offences**\n\n\n1. The\nfacts for the Aggravated Robbery conviction on 14 December 2000 (as a\njuvenile) indicate that on 7 February 2000 the applicant and an associate\nentered a newsagent.\nThe applicant proceeded to take money from the cash\nregister with his left hand while pushing at the shop assistant with his right\nhand. After taking $250 cash from the cash register, the applicant and the\nassociate ran from the newsagency.\n2. The\nfacts for the Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm conviction on 25\nJanuary 2002, indicate that on 18 November 2000 the applicant was seated outside\nlicenced premises when he called\nout to a passer-by: *“What are you\nlooking at?”*. The person stopped walking and looked at the applicant,\nwhereby the applicant proceeded to throw a plastic container of food at\nhim. The\ncontainer hit the person in the face, causing his glasses to fall. The applicant\nthen hit the victim’s face with his\nfist, causing a small laceration and\nbruising, and resulting in the victim falling to the ground. Police arrived and\nobserved the\napplicant to swing a punch at security staff of the hotel. The\napplicant was arrested and placed in a police truck. He was heard\nto call out to\na passer-by *“You old fuckhead, I’ll get you on Monday”,*\nand *“Expect a petrol bomb on your house”.*\n3. The\nfacts for the Robbery in Company conviction on 25 February 2002 indicate\nthat on 2 July 2001, the applicant and an associate approached a woman who was\nseated in\na vehicle with a mobile phone. The associate proceeded to snatch the\nphone from the victim’s hand. The applicant did not reach\ntowards the\nvictim or join in the wresting of the phone from the victim. The applicant and\nthe associate ran from the scene. Nearby\npolice approached and the applicant was\nsubsequently arrested.\n4. The\nfacts for the Aggravated Armed Robbery, Possess Loaded Firearm in a\nPublic Place, and Possess Unregistered Firearm convictions on 18 December 2010\nindicate that on the\nmorning of 7 December 2009, the applicant attended a hotel\nin the inner city. Present in the hotel were staff members, including\na chef,\ncleaner, supervisor and a female manager. The applicant was wearing a black\njumper with a built in mask with a skeleton face,\nand had gloves and a backpack.\nInside the backpack was a loaded pistol. The female manager observed the\napplicant to remove a pistol\nfrom his backpack. She ran from the bistro area\ntowards the bar area to inform the hotel supervisor. However, she was\nintercepted\nby the applicant who ordered her to kneel to the floor. The\napplicant also ordered the cleaner, who was nearby, to kneel. He pointed\nthe\npistol at him and cocked it. When the female manager tried to stand up, the\napplicant pushed the pistol into the lower area of\nher back. The applicant moved\nthem both towards the front bar, and approached the supervisor, demanding he\nopen the safe. The applicant\npointed the pistol at the supervisor and the other\nstaff members, saying, *“this is a robbery, this is serious”.*\nHe again ordered the cleaner and the female manger to kneel, while the\nsupervisor emptied cash takings from the safe. The application\nthen placed the\ntakings into his backpack and said: *“Everyone back out to the TAB area,\nthis is a real gun”.* The applicant proceeded to open the till and take\nthe contents. The total amount taken was $6,708.60.\n5. The\napplicant ran from the hotel and a police pursuit entailed. The applicant, with\nthe pistol in his hand, kept running despite instructions\nby police to stop. He\nran through a unit complex, waving the pistol around. The applicant ran in front\nof a taxi and then entered\nit. Police stopped the taxi and apprehended the\napplicant, who was subsequently arrested and charged.\n6. The\napplicant pleaded guilty to the offences of Robbery While Armed with a Dangerous\nWeapon, Possess Loaded Firearm in Public Place,\nand Posses Unregistered Firearm.\nIn his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge considered the\napplicant’s offending to be\nvery serious. There was planning and a\nconsiderable sum of money involved. It involved a cocked and loaded gun which\nwas pointed\nat the victims. His Honour accepted that the applicant was on drugs\nat the time and stole under the influence of drugs, which was\nnot an excuse, but\nmerely an explanation for the applicant’s conduct. His Honour made\nreference to a serious assault on the\napplicant 6-7 months prior to the\noffending, during which the applicant sustained gunshot wounds. His Honour found\nthat problems\nwith withdrawing from opiate based pain relief medication saw the\napplicant relapse into heroin use which he had not previously used\nfor a number\nof years. His Honour found that the shooting and its sequelae explained the\napplicant’s decision to return to\ndrugs.\n7. His\nHonour found the case had unusual features because of the applicant’s\nbackground and circumstances, including his troubled\nchildhood. His Honour found\nthe applicant to be a witness of truth, and accepted the applicant’s\nexpression of contrition and\nhis intent not to re-offend as genuine. His Honour\naccepted the applicant’s evidence on all matters, including how it was\nthat\nhe relapsed into drug use. His Honour noted that the applicant had not\nrelapsed into drug use while in custody, and had a practicable\nand plausible\nplan to enrol in study in order to work as a personal trainer, and volunteer at\nthe school where he had studied. His\nHonour regarded the applicant as having\nvery good prospects of rehabilitation.\n8. In\nsentencing the applicant to a total of 5 years’ imprisonment with a\nnon-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, His Honour\nfound that special\ncircumstances existed for the imposition of a longer than usual parole\nperiod.\n9. The\nTribunal finds the applicant’s offences of violence were serious,\nparticularly, his most recent offences. The offence of\nAggravated Armed Robbery\ncarries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. The offences of Possess\nLoaded Firearm in a Public Place\nand Possess Unregistered Firearm each carry\nmaximum penalties of 10 years imprisonment. Each of those penalties is\nindicative of\nthe level of severity with which such offences are\nregarded.\n\n*The period of time since those offences or matters\noccurred and the conduct of the applicant since that time* \n\n\n1. It\nis approximately 5 years and 4 months since the applicant’s most recent\ncriminal offending occurred. The prior violent offences\noccurred approximately\n14 years ago and earlier.\n2. His\nrecord indicates that the applicant committed most of his offending as a\njuvenile and young adult. Prior to his most recent convictions\nfor his 2009\noffending, there was an 8-year period in which the applicant had no convictions\nfor violent criminal offences. For the\nmajority of this period, it appears the\napplicant was not using heroin. However, he relapsed into heroin use in 2009,\nwhich ultimately\nled to his offending later that year.\n3. Following\nhis arrest for the 2009 offences, the applicant remained in custody up until his\nrelease from prison on parole on 6 September\n2012. The applicant’s parole\nperiod ended on 6 March 2015.\n4. There\nis no record of any allegations of a sexual or violent nature having been made\nagainst the applicant since his release from\nprison on 6 September 2012.\n5. Rather,\nthe evidence indicates the applicant, since the 2009 offence, has embarked on a\nnumber of courses of study and rehabilitation\nprograms while in custody and upon\nhis release on parole. In particular, while in prison the applicant completed\nthe following courses:\n\t* Cert III Metal\n\tFabrication\n\t* Cert III Small\n\tBusiness Management\n\t* SMART\n\t* Preparatory HSC\n\tMaths\n\t* Managing\n\tEmotions\n\t* Hey DAD\n\t(parenting and domestic violence)\n\t* Responsible\n\tConduct of Gambling\n\t* CALM\n\t* Art\n\t* Managing\n\tEmotions\n6. Towards\nthe end of his prison term, the applicant also participated in Ngara Nura, a\n6-month pre-release residential drug treatment\nprogram at Long Bay Correctional\nCentre, which involved day and weekend leave.\n7. The\napplicant states that he had set himself a goal of achieving full time\nemployment and having private accommodation. Since leaving\nprison, he secured\ntemporary supported accommodation, gained identification documents including a\ndriver’s licence, birth certificate,\nand citizenship certificate. He also\nundertook various educational courses including:\n\t* Cert IV in\n\tFitness,\n\t* Diploma of\n\tFitness\n\t* Cert III Sports\n\tTrainer, Group Exercise Instructor,\n\t* Level III Boxing\n\tCoach\n\t* Level I Strength\n\tand Conditioning Coach\n\t* Australian\n\tSports Commission Community Coach\n\t* Stepping On\n\tFalls prevention facilitator.\n8. As\na result of the applicant’s studies and experience, the applicant is now a\nqualified fitness professional with Fitness Australia\nand an Australian Strength\nand Conditioning Association Coach. He is registered in those occupations.\n9. Since\nhis release from prison, the applicant has undertaken volunteer work, including\nassisting at sporting events, hospital and charitable\norganisations, a homeless\nshelter, and mentoring students at a school for homeless youth.\n10. The\napplicant has also engaged in paid employment since his release from prison. He\nworked for a short time at a gymnasium within\na swimming complex. Within the\nsecond month of his employment, he states he had been awarded employee of the\nmonth. Although children\nwere not permitted to be in the gymnasium unsupervised,\nthey could use the pool area of the facility. The applicant said he resigned\nfrom that position as he was concerned the pending risk assessment would affect\nhis current and future employment prospects.\n11. During\nhis parole period and to the present time, the applicant has operated a fitness\nand personal training business, for which he\nis both registered and insured.\nAfter his resignation from the gymnasium, he was subcontracted by a fitness\nbusiness for approximately\nthree terms from 2013 to 2014. It involved conducting\nactivities for children from kindergarten to year 6 at various primary schools.\nThe applicant said he resigned from that position as a result of the\nbusiness’ request for a working with children check clearance.\nHe states\nthere were no complaints about his conduct during his work with the\nbusiness.\n12. Since\nthat work, the applicant has conducted short term personal training sessions and\nhas developed fitness programs for organisations,\nincluding athletics and boxing\nclubs. He maintains both his business name and insurance. He states he has been\noffered two positions\nwhich have attractive remuneration packages. However, he\ndeclined those offers on the basis that both positions require the applicant\nto\nhold a working with children check clearance.\n13. At\nthe present time the applicant is in receipt of Newstart Allowance payments from\nCentrelink. He is still actively seeking work\nin the fitness industry. However,\nhe said the vast majority of positions require a working with children’s\ncheck clearance,\nwhich he has been unable to provide.\n14. The\napplicant states that he lives in community housing, and has a support worker\nfrom Wesley Mission. He previously had support from\nthe Community Restorative\nJustice Centre. The applicant’s accommodation is available until the end\nof 2016. However, the applicant\nintends to obtain private accommodation in the\nevent he gains employment in his industry.\n15. During\nthe period of his parole, the applicant was required to attend regular\ncounselling at the Wentworth Forensic Clinic. His attendance\nis now voluntary\ngiven his parole period has now concluded. At the Tribunal haring on 27 March\n2015, the applicant said he has initiated\nfurther counselling at the Clinic and\nhas an appointment scheduled for the following week. He also said he has regular\nappointments\nwith a doctor, and attends Narcotics Anonymous meetings every 1-2\nweeks.\n16. The\napplicant has a 7 month old baby daughter, who he sees every day. Whilst he is\nnot in an intimate relationship with the baby’s\nmother, he reports that\nthey have a very good relationship.\n17. The\napplicant has involvement with two gymnasiums, and continues to train and\nmaintain his fitness. He also surfs and is a part of\na social touch football\nteam which he also coaches.\n18. Since\n2011, the applicant has been subjected to regular drug testing, both in prison\nand during his release on parole. Of the 21 tests\nadministered, all have\nreturned negative results. The applicant said he does not use any drugs nor does\nhe drink alcohol or caffeine.\nThe strongest medication he uses is\nPanadol.\n\n*The age of the applicant at the time the offending\noccurred*\n\n\n1. The\napplicant was aged between 15 and 21 years at the time his earlier violent\noffending occurred. He was aged 27 at the time he committed\nthe 2009\noffences.\n\n*The age of the victim at the time the offending\noccurred and any matters relating to vulnerability of the victim* \n\n\n1. The\nvictims of the offences committed by the applicant were adults. There is no\nevidence that any of his victims were children.\n2. The\nvictims of the applicant’s offences were innocent people going about their\nbusiness and lives. The victims were not known\nto the applicant, and in this\nsense, were random. The applicant’s actions, particularly in relation to\nthe 2009 offending,\nwere likely to have caused significant emotional trauma to\nthe victims.\n\n*The difference in age between the victim and the\napplicant*\n\n\n1. The\ndifference in age between the applicant and the victims of his offences is not\nknown.\n\n*Whether the applicant knew, or could reasonably have\nknown, that the victim was a child*\n\n\n1. There\nis no evidence that any of the victims were children.\n\n*The\napplicant’s present age*\n\n\n1. The\napplicant is now 32 years of age.\n\n*The seriousness of the\napplicant’s total criminal record*\n\n\n1. The\napplicant has an extensive criminal record. In addition to the offences which\ntriggered the respondent’s risk assessment\n(which are underlined below),\nthe applicant has been convicted of the following offences:\n\n**As a\njuvenile**\n\n\n\n> \n> (1) 8 July 1998: Steal from the Person. The applicant was ordered to enter into\n> a recognizance for 12 months, to submit to supervision\n> by the Juvenile Justice\n> Services and to attend school regularly.  \n>   \n> \n> (2) 13 January 1999: Assault Officer in Execution of Duty (x2); Resist\n> Officer in execution of duty; Drive conveyance taken without consent of\n> owner, drive in dangerous manner, drive in manner dangerous to the public. The\n> applicant\n> was ordered to enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for 2 years,\n> with supervision of the Juvenile Justice Branch and to attend\n> counselling.  \n>   \n> \n> (3) 14 December 2000: Aggravated Robbery. The applicant was ordered to\n> perform 50 hours of community service.\n\nAs an adult\n\n\n\n> \n> (1) 14 December 2001: Resist Officer in Execution of Duty. The applicant\n> was fined $200.  \n>   \n> \n> (2) 24 January 2002: Fail to Comply with Community Service Order.  \n>   \n> \n> (3) 25 January 2002: Use Offensive language x 2, Assault occasioning actual\n> bodily harm; custody of a knife in a public place; Larceny, Obtain Benefit\n> by Deception x 3, Possess Prohibited Drug. The applicant was sentenced\n> to six\n> months’ imprisonment, and fined $100.  \n>   \n> \n> (4) 22 February 2002: Robbery In Company. The applicant was sentenced to\n> four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years.   \n>   \n> \n> (5) 28 September 2006: Possess Implements to enter/ drive conveyance. The\n> applicant was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment  \n>   \n> \n> (6) 18 November 2010: Aggravated Robbery; Possess loaded firearm in a\n> public place; possess unregistered firearm. The applicant was sentenced to\n> imprisonment for five years and three months, with a non-parole period of two\n> years and nine months.\n\n1. The\napplicant’s criminal record is serious, as is reflected in the sentences\nof imprisonment imposed in respect of (6)(7)(8)\nand (9). The evidence indicates\nthat the offences were committed in the context of the applicant’s\nsubstance use and anti-social\nbehaviour. Despite being apparently drug-free for\na period of years, the applicant relapsed into heroin use, and his offending in\n2009 was directly related to his drug addiction and his need to fund\nit.\n\n*The likelihood of any repetition by the applicant of the\noffence or conduct and the impact on children of any such repetition*\n\n\n1. In\nregard to the likelihood of further offending and the applicant’s violence\nrisk, the respondent relied upon the Violent Offender\nAssessment report of Toni\nQuayle for the period September to December 2011. Ms Quayle’s assessment\nindicated the applicant’s\nstatic risk factors were as follows: use of\nviolence and offending history from a young age; dysfunctional family history,\nincluding\nuse of corporal punishment by his mother; poor educational and\nvocational history; prior supervision failure as a youth and young\nadult. The\ndynamic risk factors included: substance abuse; cycles of violence and use of\nweapons; impulsivity; criminal attitudes;\nboredom and poor work ethic; criminal\npeers; relationships, stability and lack of community supports. Dynamic Acute\nrisk factors\nincluded: poor emotional control, namely, perceived disrespect;\nsubstance abuse; access to weapons. The applicant’s strengths\nwere listed\nas his supportive female friend; current positive attitude to supervision;\ndeveloping resilience; developing understanding\nof victim empathy; acceptance of\nresponsibility for offence; and voluntary and paid work.\n2. The\nresults of that risk assessment estimated the applicant’s overall risk of\nre-offending as within the upper limit of the\nModerate range. At the conclusion\nof her assessment, Ms Quayle indicated that the applicant would need to\neffectively manage his\nidentified risk factors to reduce his level of risk. Ms\nQuayle made a number of recommendations, including that the applicant\nparticipate\nin the Ngara Nura program, the MRV pathway that includes Managing\nEmotions and CALM programs; counselling to assist in managing PTSD\nsymptoms,\nreferral to an employment service, educational courses to meet his goal of\nestablishing his own personal training business;\nand assistance with finding\npositive leisure pursuits.\n3. During\nhis parole period, the applicant was referred for psychological sessions at the\nWentworth Forensic Clinic. Mr Kevin O’Sullivan,\nthe psychologist who\nreviewed the applicant on four occasions, reported in June 2013 that the\napplicant appeared to be managing his\nrisk well, as demonstrated by studying and\nplanning his own business venture realistically; involving himself in pro-social\nleisure\nactivities; and associating with pro-social groups. Mr Sullivan reported\nthat the applicant had an awareness of his vulnerabilities\nin terms of anger,\nand had a well-thought out plan for managing situations that present a risk of\nviolence; including abstinence\nfrom heroin, and an ability to reflect on his own\nbehaviour. Mr Sullivan noted the applicant *“seems to have a remarkable\nability to observe and learn from others and to try alternative ways of\nbeing”.*\n4. In\nNovember 2014, the applicant was reviewed by Mr York Hong and Ms Anita McGregor,\nPsychologists from the Wentworth Forensic Clinic,\nfor the purposes of an updated\nassessment of the applicant’s violence risk, made at the request of the\napplicant’s parole\nofficer.\n5. Mr\nHong noted that the applicant’s risk of violent reoffending in 2011 was\nassessed as being in the upper Medium range. However,\non testing in November\n2014, the applicant’s risk rating was found to be in the Low range.\n6. In\nexplaining in this reduction in the risk rating, Mr Hong stated the\napplicant’s static risk factors are becoming more removed\nfrom the\napplicant’s current circumstances and therefore greater emphasis was\nplaced on the applicant’s dynamic factors.\nThe dynamic risk factors\nspecifically identified in the 2011 risk assessment were addressed in Mr\nHong’s 2014 assessment, with\nfindings as follows:\n\t* *Criminal\n\tpersonality* – the applicant appears to have accepted prosocial\n\tinfluences due to treatment, insight and acceptance and motivation of prosocial\n\tlife goals.\n\t* *Criminal\n\tattitudes* – the applicant endorsed few criminal attitudes. Rather he\n\tdisplayed prosocial attitudes which included desire to work and\n\tto be part of\n\tsociety and not be labelled by his criminal past.\n\t* *Work\n\tEthic* – evidence suggests the applicant has a positive and prosocial\n\twork ethic, demonstrated by education and studies.\n\t* *Criminal\n\tpeers* – the applicant appears to have insight into associating with\n\tcriminal peers, and now associates with pro-social peers through\n\this studies and\n\ttouch football.\n\t* *Emotional\n\tControl* – the applicant appears to have benefitted from treatment and\n\tdoes not appear to be a current risk factor.\n\t* *Weapon Use\n\t– this factor has become less relevant and there is no evidence or police\n\tintelligence of any current weapon use\n\tor possession.*\n\t* *Insight into\n\tViolence – Identified as strength for the applicant.*\n\t* *Substance\n\tAbuse – this risk factor is less prominent in light of the\n\tapplicant’s 5 years of abstinence. Although it remains\n\tan important risk\n\tfactor, the applicant appears to have gained insight and coping strategies\n\tassociated with his previous substance\n\tuse, and no treatment seems necessary.\n\tHowever, if the applicant experiences crisis, he may require support to reduce\n\trisk of relapse.*\n\t* *Community\n\tSupport – the applicant appears to have prosocial support. He states he\n\thas learnt how to access support if he requires\n\tit.*\n\t* *Violence\n\tCycle – These have become less prominent and have been addressed via\n\tintervention. The applicant appears to have insight\n\tinto his cycles of violence,\n\tand benefited from treatment. He admits that although he has insight while\n\tabstinent, he has identified\n\tthat if he relapses he may not be thinking\n\tclearly.*\n\t* *Impulsivity\n\t– the applicant’s behaviour since release suggests strong future\n\tplanning and consequential thinking, which\n\tis identified as strength and a\n\tprotective factor in reducing his violence risk.*\n\t* *Compliance\n\twith Community Supervision – the applicant has had few issues with\n\tcompliance during the parole period and has demonstrated\n\tthe ability to resolve\n\tissues*.\n7. Mr\nHong also used the Measure of Criminal Attitudes and Associates (MCAA) to assess\nthe applicant’s violence risk. Mr Hong states\nthe applicant’s scores\nwere within normal limits, suggesting that overall the applicant does not appear\nto have unusually elevated\ncriminal attitudes or unusually large amounts of\ncriminal associates.\n8. A\nfurther tool used by Mr Hong during the assessment was the Structured Assessment\nof Protective Factors of Violence Risk (SAPROF).\nMr Hong identified the\napplicant’s strongest protective factors as (1) Intelligence (as evidenced\nby his completion of a number\nof education and skills courses), (2) Effective\nCoping Skills and (3) Self-Control (as evidenced by his abstinence from illicit\nsubstances,\ncaffeine and cigarettes, as well as engaging in SMART and Managing\nEmotions courses, and the use of consequential thinking).\n9. In\nhis summary and recommendations, Mr Hong opines that the applicant has\nsignificantly reduced his risk of violent offending, resulting\nin the reduction\nfrom the upper Medium range to the Low range. Whilst the risk assessment did not\nspecifically address the risk of\nworking with children, Mr Hong noted the\napplicant’s adult criminal history has not included specific violence\nagainst children\nor underage victims, suggesting that the applicant does not\npose a specific risk of violence against children. As a result, Mr Hong\nopined\nthat “*if his current risk factors are managed and his protective\nfactors remain in place, his overall risk of violence towards the general\npopulation as well as children would remain low”.*\n10. However,\nMr Hong identified four areas in which the applicant would benefit from further\nsupport or intervention: (1) Employment (the\n2011 report identified that the\napplicant may become bored when faced with large amounts of unsupervised time\nwhich could increase\nhis risk of offending); (2) Professional Care – (at\nthe time of the report, the applicant had not engaged in professional care\nbesides attending Narcotics Anonymous, but had shown interest in attending the\nWentworth Forensic Clinic); (3) Positive Attitudes\ntowards Authority –\nWhilst the applicant has complied with his parole order and community\nsupervision since his release, he\nhas self identified his automatic negative\nthoughts associated with authority figures; (4) Social Network – Whilst\nthe applicant\nidentified his close friend, his friends from his studies, and his\ntouch football friends, as people who would support him if he\nwas in trouble,\nthis was not tested and is a potential treatment target.\n11. Mr\nHong noted the applicant has not experienced a situation of crisis and he has\nnot felt the need to engage in his supports. Mr Hong\nstates the\napplicant’s risk of reoffending would be increased if he experiences drug\nrelapse and disengagement from his goals;\nfor example, loss of important social\nsupports or employment, inability to work in the personal fitness field and/or\nfailing the\nworking with children check clearance risk assessment.\n12. Mr\nHong states gainful employment has been identified to be a strong protective\nfactor against re-offending. He states the applicant\nis currently under-employed\nand would recommend some additional support for the applicant to secure stable\nemployment preferably\nwithin his desired field of personal fitness.\n13. Mr\nHong states the applicant may benefit from additional professional support,\nincluding at the Wentworth Forensic Clinic or another\nmental health service. Mr\nHong states the applicant may also benefit from interventions in relation to\ndrug relapse prevention, dealings\nwith authority figures, increasing his usage\nof social and professional supports when destabilising warning signs arise prior\nto\ncrisis.\n14. Mr\nHong’s supervisor, Mrs Anita McGregor, Senior Forensic Psychologist, was\npresent during the interview with the applicant\nand supports the conclusions of\nMr Hong. She gave evidence at the Tribunal hearing and was cross-examined by the\nrespondent. She\nmaintains her opinion that the applicant poses a low risk of\nviolent reoffending.\n15. When\ncross-examined by Counsel for the respondent about the applicant’s\nmotivation to enrol in Ngara Nura program, Ms McGregor\nsaid that it would be\nreasonable for an offender to identify multiple reasons, including release from\nprison, for attending programs\nand training. When asked questions about the\napplicant’s abstinence from drugs, Ms McGregor stated that there was no\nevidence\nthat the applicant’s abstinence from drugs was externally driven.\nRather, she is of the view that the applicant’s abstinence\nappears to be\nmore internally driven, as evidenced by his abstinence not solely from drugs and\nalcohol, but from caffeine, tobacco\nand other unhealthy things.\n16. Mrs\nMcGregor noted during the interview that the applicant had identified specific\nstrategies he would utilise if he came across persons\nwith former criminal\nassociates. During the course of cross examination, Ms McGregor, stated that in\nher more than 20 years of experience\nin conducting such assessments, it was the\nfirst time an offender had indicated specific steps, rather than identifying an\navoidance\nstrategy only.\n17. When\nquestioned about the fact that the applicant has been in a structured\nenvironment, both in prison and while on parole, Mrs McGregor\nstated that parole\nis very different from a prison environment. She states that most people on\nparole are not released into a structured\nenvironment and are given “a lot\nmore rope” and opportunities than in a custodial context. Ms McGregor\ndenied that being\nsubjected to drug testing is a significant\n“structure”, and further stated that it is an almost universal\ncondition of\nparole, and can be “beaten” relatively easily.\n18. Ms\nMcGregor told the Tribunal that the highest risk of violent offending for males\ngenerally occurs when testosterone levels are at\ntheir highest, around the ages\nof 17 years to late twenties. In the applicant’s case, Ms McGregor said\nthat the applicant is\nat the low risk level and, purely on age alone, is on the\nway down to an even lower risk.\n\n**Any information given by the\napplicant**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant relied on his statutory declaration dated 28 November 2014, as well as\nhis oral evidence. The applicant has a Sri Lankan\nbackground and was raised by\nhis parents who divorced when the applicant was a child. He subsequently resided\nin the care of his\nmother, who was very young, in a new country and with 3 young\nchildren to raise. The applicant said he was not provided with a nurturing\nenvironment and his physical and emotional wellbeing was unstable. As a\nconsequence, at age 13, he left home and subsequently experienced\nperiods of\nhomelessness. He also started using alcohol and drugs at an early age; including\nmarijuana and alcohol from about 10 -12\nyears of age and heroin from about 12-15\nyears of age. The applicant said that since leaving his mother’s care, the\nonly times\nhe received residential, emotional and physical care were the periods\nhe spent in juvenile detention centres and while he attended\na school for\nhomeless youth, at which he completed his Year 10 Certificate and received an\naward of excellence.\n2. He\nstates after leaving school he moved back into his mother’s home and\ncommenced employment at a cabinet-making factory. However,\ndue to the tension in\nthe household, he was told to leave. He became homeless once again, and was\nusing heroin. He said that heroin\n“would later go on to have a\nstranglehold on me physically, emotionally, financially and spiritually”.\nHe said that he\nused heroin for many reasons, including peer pressure, the need\nto be part of a group, and to prove he wasn’t scared of using.\n3. He\nsaid he kept committing crime and eventually entered prison. He states that he\ncan now see that before he went to prison, he was\nyoung, alone and desperate to\nbelong and be accepted, and this resulted in him gravitating towards people\nolder than him, believing\nthat they cared for him. However, he stated those\nrelationships with peers were destructive and co-dependent.\n4. He\nstates he first entered prison naïve and impressionable, and prison life\nwas harsh for a teenager with a Sri Lankan background.\nHe used violence as a\nmeans of defending himself, as he didn’t want to join a gang or be a\nvictim of physical and/or sexual\nviolence. He said that upon leaving prison aged\n22; the only thing he learned was how to look after his physical health. He did\nnot\nundertake any education or programs to address his offending behaviour and\nhe states he *“left prison worse off than when I\nentered”.*\n5. In\nrelation to the Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm offence in 2000, the\napplicant said he had seen a person looking at him,\nwhich he interpreted it as a\nlook he did not appreciate, and which resulted in him throwing a container of\nfried rice at his face.\nThe applicant said on impact, the container exploded and\nscratched the victim’s cheek. Whilst unable to recall all of the specific\ndetails of the offence, he said he agreed with everything in the facts. He said\nhe was very young and was trying to act tough. At\nthat time, he was listening to\nrap music and associating with older people, for whom that type of behaviour\nwould be accepted and\napplauded. He said he felt a need to act out aggressively\nto others, and whilst his use of alcohol and drugs were not an excuse for\nhis\nconduct, it provided an explanation for it.\n6. In\nrelation to the offence of Robbery in Company in 2001, the applicant said he was\nhomeless and using drugs (although withdrawing\nfrom them). He was walking around\naimlessly and looking for drugs when he met with an associate/s who observed a\nwoman on a mobile\ntelephone. The applicant agreed he was acting as a look-out\n(while the associate took the phone).\n7. In\nrelation to his criminal offending, the applicant in cross-examination said he\ndid not dispute any of the facts. He said that his\noffending was often in the\ncontext of seeking to obtain heroin. He said that emotionally, he had not\nmatured and that his use of\ndrugs had stunted his mental growth, and he lacked\nthe ability to cope with setbacks, and deal with feelings and emotions.\n8. In\nrelation to the 2009 offences, the applicant said he did not disagree with the\nremarks of the sentencing judge. At the time of\nthe commission of the offence,\nthat applicant had been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and had\nbeen withdrawing from\nstrong opiate medication prescribed to relieve the pain\nassociated with his gunshot wounds. When the medication ceased, the applicant\nrelapsed into heroin. He said he had taken sleeping tablets the night before he\ncommitted the offence, and on awaking the next morning\nwith no ease of his\nsymptoms, he planned to commit the robbery in order to obtain money for\nheroin.\n9. The\napplicant states that his last offending in 2009 was the last time he used a\ndrug. He said when he re-entered prison he made a\ndecision that it was the last\ntime he would be a burden on society. He said that while in prison, he avoided\nassociating with people\nhe knew previously, and undertook whatever education he\ncould. He said he set a goal of finding accommodation and employment upon\nhis\nrelease from prison.\n10. In\nhis evidence, the applicant said that he does not wish to go backwards in his\nlife, and that he has learned how to prevent situations\noccurring that had\npreviously led to his offending. He said that if he does come across anti-social\npeers it is only when he has\nattended the Parole Office, and not in any other\ncontext. He said that when he has come into contact with such persons, he is\ncourteous\nand respectful. He said it is very easy for him to exit a\nconversation, and that he no longer has a need to please people.\n11. The\napplicant also said that in the past he only had a narrow view of the services\nand supports available to him. However, he said\nthat now he is very aware of\nsuch services and is confident in his ability to access them before the problem\nescalates out of his\ncontrol. He said even if that were to occur, he is aware of\nthe services he could turn to.\n12. The\napplicant also said that if he is working with children and is confronted with a\nchild with challenging behaviours being racist\nand disrespectful, he would say\nto the child to leave the situation and to return when the child is ready to\ncome back and participate\nwithin the boundaries of mutual respect. If the\nbehaviour occurs in a school setting, the applicant said he would direct the\nmatter\nto a teacher. The applicant said his Australian Sports Commission course\ntaught him that children who display challenging behaviours\noften do so in group\nsituations, and in the context of a need to “show-off”. The\napplicant said that situation is often\nbest dealt with by allocating the child a\nspecific task to undertake.\n13. The\napplicant was cross-examined at length by counsel for the respondent. The\nTribunal formed the view that the applicant was a credible\nwitness and was frank\nand forthcoming in his evidence. He did not seek to minimise his offending, and\ndid not dispute the facts as\nthey were alleged. The Tribunal formed the view\nthat the applicant is remorseful for his crimes, and is genuinely motivated to\nlive\na productive life, free from drugs and crime.\n14. Ms\nBonwick, a teacher at the school the applicant attended as a homeless youth,\nprovided a reference in support of the applicant.\nMs Bonwick has known the\napplicant for more than 10 years and is aware of his criminal offences and\nperiods of imprisonment. In her\nview, much of that offending occurred in the\ncontext of his difficult upbringing. Ms Bonwick said she believes that there is\nso much\ngood in the applicant and still believes this to be true. She states she\nnever had cause for concern for his dealings with children\nor young adults while\ninvolved with the school. She considers him a good role model who she encourages\nto talk to the students about\nhis own experiences.\n15. Mr\nBrown, the senior counsellor at a youth & community services organisation,\nhas known the applicant since the applicant was\n16 years of age and living on\nthe streets. Mr Brown is aware of the applicant’s criminal record and the\nbackground to his childhood\nand youth. Mr Brown opined that the applicant is\nrehabilitated. Mr Brown expressed his belief, consistent with his belief about\nthe\napplicant when 16 years of age, that the applicant is not intrinsically\naggressive or violent. Mr Brown said the applicant has reflected\non his place in\nthe community and his role in the crimes he has committed. Mr Brown said that\nhis organisation would employ him in\nthe event a position is available and the\napplicant is provided with a working with children check clearance.\n16. The\napplicant also relied on a reference provided by Mr Ajay Phillip, the\napplicant’s former case worker at the Community Restorative\nCentre’s\nMen’s Transition Program. That program is a voluntary support program to\nassist men to transition from prison\nback to the community upon release, and\nincludes assistance with accommodation, employment, welfare, drug and alcohol\nissues, and\nrelationship issues. Mr Phillip stated the applicant contacted the\nCentre approximately one year before his release from prison,\nvoluntarily\nseeking support to assist with his plans and goals, including to abstain from\nillicit drugs and alcohol, and to undertake\neducation, employment and\nvolunteering opportunities.\n17. The\napplicant lived for several months in accommodation operated by the Centre,\nwhose staff report the applicant was an exemplary\ntenant. Mr Phillip stated:\n*“In my experience, (the applicant) has been exceptionally proactive in\nfurthering the positive endeavours in his life and has\ndemonstrated his desire\nand a consistent, driven work ethic towards success in his chosen field of\nFitness, as well as genuinely\npro-social endeavours and life choices through his\npositive community connections through his TAFE and sport social circles, to\nname\na few”.* Mr Phillip stated that the applicant has been working\nhard towards a different life, pro-social and free from any future involvement\nin the criminal justice system, and had made good use of the Centre’s\nsupport in helping to achieve his goals. Mr Phillip stated\nthat he both\npersonally and professionally strongly urges that the application for a working\nwith children check clearance to be\nassessed positively.\n18. The\napplicant did not provide any references from his recent employers. This is\ndespite being offered a number of opportunities to\ndo so during the application\nprocess. The applicant stated he has not done so as he does not believe it would\nbe in his interests\nto alert his employers to his previous criminal history and\nto the fact that he was being scrutinised by the Office of the Children’s\nGuardian. The applicant states there were no complaints about his conduct while\nworking with children. He also said that when he\nwas previously employed at a\ngymnasium, he was offered future work at any time.\n19. The\napplicant told the Tribunal that he continues to attend counselling at the\nWentworth Clinic and has a support worker from Wesley\nMission. He said his plan\nis to obtain private accommodation and full time employment. In this regard, he\nsaid that the vast majority\nof the jobs he applies for require him to hold a\nworking with children check clearance.\n20. In\nhis oral submissions to the Tribunal, the applicant stated that he agreed that\nchild protection and the protection and safety and\nwelfare of children is of the\nutmost priority. He said he has never been a threat to children. He said he has\nmade every bad choice\nin life and there have been victims as a result of his\nactions, however, he has never abused or harmed children. He said that he\nhas\nbeen to prison for his crimes, and has learned from his mistakes. He said he is\na qualified children’s trainer, and that\nthere is no evidence of any\ncomplaint about his work with children. He said that his own experiences in\nchildhood adds to his capability.\nHe said that he has prosocial links to the\ncommunity and has support from Ms K. He has employment available to him if he is\nable\nto receive a working with children check clearance.\n21. The\napplicant told the Tribunal that he is truly remorseful for his crimes, and he\ncomes before the Tribunal as a changed man, having\nmade every effort to turn his\nlife around. He said he has changed everything about him, and that he has not\ndone so just when someone\nis around or watching. He submitted that the grant of\na working with children check clearance would have a positive impact on himself\nand the community. He said it would enable him to gain employment, pay taxes,\nand encourage others to lead a healthy life, and be\na role model for children.\nHe said he plans to enrol in a Bachelor of Social Work degree at university to\nenable him to work with\nyoung people at risk to further this\naim.\n\n*Any other matters the respondent considers necessary*\n\n\n1. The\nrespondent contends that the decision the subject of review is the correct and\npreferred decision and should be affirmed.\n2. The\nrespondent submits that the applicant’s 2009 offending was very serious.\nIt involved a loaded weapon, was planned and was\ncommitted for the purposes of\nobtaining drugs. The respondent also noted the applicant’s assault in 2000\nwas on a stranger\nand was unprovoked. He said both offences were in the context\nof a drug and/or alcohol use. The respondent points to the fact that\nfifteen\nmonths after the applicant’s release from prison in 2007 he had relapsed\ninto heroin use, and it was in the context\nof that relapse that the 2009\noffending occurred. The respondent submits that while on drugs, the applicant\nhas engaged in violent\nbehaviour, and such violent behaviour, if repeated, may\naffect children indirectly.\n3. The\nrespondent also submits that while on parole, the applicant has had structure in\nthe form of accommodation, support services,\nand parole conditions including\ndrug testing. The respondent submits that the applicant’s abstinence from\ndrugs has occurred\nwhile the applicant has been subject to supervision and\nstructure both in prison and on parole. The respondent submits that the truer\ntest is when the applicant is no longer subject to parole, and has no\nrestrictions in the community.\n4. The\nrespondent concedes that whilst the applicant has significantly reduced his risk\nof relapse, he has not yet experienced crisis.\nCognizant of the fact the\napplicant’s relapse occurred when he had isolated himself from supports\nand was unable to seek assistance,\nCounsel for the respondent noted Mr\nHong’s opinion that if the applicant does not engage in support services,\nthe risk of violent\nre-offending would be increased.\n5. The\nrespondent therefore submits the three main areas of concern are as\nfollows:\n\t* (1) The absence\n\tof evidence of the applicant being drug free in circumstances where there are no\n\tparole conditions and he is not supported\n\tby a structured program;\n\t* (2) The lack of\n\tevidence the applicant has experienced a crisis situation;\n\t* (3) The lack of\n\tevidence the applicant would seek full assistance and support should he relapse\n\tinto drug use.\n6. The\nrespondent submits that the situation might be cured with the passage of time,\nas it would enable a longer period of abstinence\nfrom drugs and a likelihood of\na crisis arising. The respondent suggests the applicant may seek to enliven the\ndiscretion of the\nChildren’s Guardian under section 21(2)(d) to permit an\nearly further application for a working with children check clearance\nat some\ntime in the future, possibly in 2-3 years. However, the respondent submits that\nat the present time, it is too soon for the\napplicant to be granted a working\nwith children check clearance.\n\n**Conclusions and orders**\n\n\n1. The\nissue for determination is whether, on the material before it, the Tribunal can\nbe satisfied that the applicant poses a risk to\nthe safety of children. There is\nno presumption that the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children by\nreason of his offending,\nbut the safety, welfare and well-being of children, in\nparticular, protecting them from child abuse, is the paramount consideration\nin\ndetermining this application.\n2. Whilst\nthe Tribunal acknowledges that the applicant’s criminal offences did not\ninvolve children, they included violent offences\nof a serious nature. There were\na number of innocent victims, including those at whom the applicant pointed a\nloaded weapon. The\napplicant’s offending was committed in the context of\nsignificant illicit drug use, and escalated in its severity. And despite\nhaving\npreviously served sentences of imprisonment and experienced a period of\nabstinence from heroin use, in 2009 the applicant\nrelapsed into heroin use and\ncommitted further violent offences.\n3. At\nthe same time, the Tribunal finds that the applicant has matured considerably in\nthe last five years, and is genuinely motivated\nto change the course of his\nlife. He has accepted responsibility for his past actions and is remorseful. He\nhas engaged in treatment\nand counselling to address his violent past and his use\nof substances. He continues to attend counselling despite no longer being\ncompelled to do so. He has undertaken education and training to maximise his\nprospects of employment, and has volunteered in a number\nof different charitable\nevents and causes. He has started his own business and has engaged in\nemployment. He now has a child for\nwhom he has responsibilities, and has a close\nand very supportive friendship with Ms K, the baby’s mother. He coaches a\ntouch\nfootball team, engages in fitness on a regular basis, and leads a healthy\nlifestyle. All of these factors militate in the applicant’s\nfavour and he\nis to be commended for embarking on a path of rehabilitation.\n4. However,\nthe Tribunal accepts the respondent’s submission that there has been\ninsufficient time since the applicant’s\nviolent offending occurred. The\napplicant’s parole period has ended only very recently, and as result, his\noffence has only\njust been completed. In the last five years and 4 months since\nthe offending occurred, the applicant has either been in prison or\non parole.\nThe applicant has therefore not yet experienced an extended period of time\nwithout supervision or formal restrictions\nin place.\n5. Relevantly,\nfor approximately eight years between 2001 and 2009, there was an absence of\nviolent criminal offending by the applicant.\nThere was also a period of\nabstinence from heroin use. In this case, it has been only 5 years and 4 months\nsince the applicant’s\nlast criminal offending and since his last relapse\ninto heroin use. Whilst it is clear that the applicant has made very significant\nchanges to his life and has reduced his risks, his offending cannot be said to\nhave occurred in the more distant past.\n6. It\nis evident that the applicant receives considerable support from Ms K. Her\ninfluence appears to be a very good one, and during\nthe course of the\nproceedings she impressed the Tribunal with her commitment and assistance to the\napplicant. It is likely that she\nhas played a significant role in the\napplicant’s rehabilitation journey. However, the Tribunal notes that Ms K\nwas also in\nthe applicant’s life around the time of his offending in 2009.\nHer presence was acknowledged by the sentencing Judge, who was\nsimilarly\nimpressed with her capabilities. Yet, her friendship with the applicant was not,\nin itself, sufficient to prevent the applicant’s\nrelapse into heroin use\nand crime in 2009. Consistent with the submission of the respondent, and\nidentified by Mr Hong in his psychological\nreport, a failure by the applicant to\nengage in support services would increase his risk of violent reoffending.\n7. In\naddition, the Tribunal notes that the applicant elected not to provide any\ncorroborative evidence about his employment since his\nrelease from prison. The\napplicant’s fear of alerting employers to his criminal history and the\nChildren’s Guardian risk\nassessment process, meant that there was no\ncorroboration of the applicant’s account that he has not been the subject\nof any\nworkplace complaints or disciplinary action. It has also meant that there\nis limited evidence before the Tribunal of the applicant’s\nemployment and\nworkplace experience, including when previously working with children.\n8. The\nTribunal acknowledges that the applicant has been assessed as presenting a low\nrisk of violent reoffending. However, a psychological\nrisk assessment is only\npart of the material that the Tribunal may take into account in determining\nwhether the applicant poses a\nrisk to the safety of children.\n9. The\nTribunal accepts that if the applicant is granted a clearance he may work with\nany children of any age. No conditions may be imposed\nupon the grant of a\nclearance. Whilst the applicant has indicated he does not propose to work with\nchildren specifically, this is\nnot necessarily material to the Tribunal’s\ndetermination.\n10. The\nsafety, welfare and well-being of children and in particular, protecting them\nfrom child abuse is the paramount consideration\npursuant to section 4 of the\nAct. As indicated earlier, the offences with the applicant has been convicted\nare serious and involve\nviolence. Whilst children were not the victims of the\napplicant’s offences, the victims in his offences were innocent and\nindiscriminate.\nIt is clear that children can be indirect victims of violence,\nincluding in situations where the perpetrator is undiscerning as to\nthe victim\nof his or her crime. On the balance of probabilities and taking into the\nseriousness and gravity of the applicant’s\noffences, the Tribunal cannot\nbe satisfied at the present time that the applicant does not pose a risk to\nchildren.\n11. However,\nthe Tribunal’s refusal on this occasion to affirm the respondent’s\ndecision to refuse a working with children\ncheck clearance does not necessarily\nmean that the applicant will fail to obtain a clearance in the event he makes a\nfurther application\nat some time in the future. Whilst a person is prevented\nfrom making a further application for a period of five years after the refusal\nnotice was given, a change of circumstances can invoke the discretion of the\nChildren’s Guardian to permit a further application\nearlier than five\nyears (see sections 21(1)(a) and 21(2)(d)). Indeed, such a scenario was\nspecifically raised by the respondent in\nhis submissions to the Tribunal.\n12. In\nthis regard, the Tribunal finds the applicant’s progress has been very\npositive and he has demonstrated commitment to his\nrehabilitation. With further\ntreatment and counselling as suggested by Mr Hong, and further employment (in\nareas that do not require\na such a clearance), the applicant may wish to\nconsider an early application for a working with children check clearance in the\nfuture.\nHowever, it will be a matter for the Children’s Guardian to\ndetermine, on the information provided by the applicant at that\ntime, as to\nwhether that application be permitted.\n\n**Order:**\n\n\nThe order of the Tribunal therefore is:\n\n\n\n> \n> (1) The decision of the respondent dated 19 June 2014 to refuse to grant the\n> applicant a working with children check clearance is\n> affirmed.  \n>   \n> \n> (2) The application for review of the decision of the Children’s Guardian\n> filed on 14 July 2014 is otherwise refused and\n> dismissed.\n\n \n\n\nI hereby certify that this is a true and accurate record of the reasons for\ndecision of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal of New\nSouth\nWales.  \n  \nRegistrar\n\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or\nstatutory provisions prohibiting publication that may\napply to this judgment or\ndecision.

This\ncase concerns an application for administrative review under [s 27(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caata2013326/s27.html) of the\n*Child Protection (Working with Children) Act 2012* (NSW) (“**the\nAct**”) of the decision of the Children’s Guardian made on 5 April\n2022 to refuse to grant a working with children check clearance\nto the applicant\non the grounds that she poses a risk to the safety of children\n(“**Refusal Decision**”).\n2. The\napplicant had previously been granted a clearance which was cancelled on 20\nMarch 2019 when the Children’s Guardian became\naware that criminal\nproceedings had commenced against her in relation to offences specified in\nSchedule 2 of the Act.\n3. The\napplicant was charged with Indecent Assault person under 16 years of age under s\n61M(2) of the *[Crimes Act 1900](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/)* (NSW) (“**[Crimes Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/)**”) and\nfive counts of Common Assault under [s 61](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s61.html) of the [Crimes Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/) (altogether, referred\nto as the “**2019 Criminal Trial**”). The complainant had been\nplaced in the care of the applicant in her capacity as an authorised foster\ncarer and alleged that\nhe had been assaulted by her during the period he was in\nher care. In proceedings in the Parramatta Local Court, all charges were\ndismissed in early March 2021.\n4. The\napplicant then applied for a clearance under s 13 of the Act on 5 March\n2021.\n5. Upon\nreceiving that application, the Children’s Guardian was required to\nconduct a risk assessment to determine whether the\napplicant posed a risk to the\nsafety of children under s 15(1) of the Act. The fact that the applicant had\nbeen charged with, but\nnot convicted of, charges which fell into clause 1 of\nSchedule 2 of the Act triggered the requirement for the risk assessment.\n6. The\napplicant was notified in writing on 26 March 2021 of the requirement for the\nrisk assessment. She was also notified that an interim\nbar had been imposed upon\nher on the grounds that the charges indicated there may be a risk to the safety\nof children should the\napplicant engage in child-related work while the\nassessment took place.\n7. The\napplicant provided a submission to the Children’s Guardian on 7 April 2021\nand provided eleven character references in support\nof her application for\nclearance.\n8. In\nthe course of conducting the risk assessment, the Children’s Guardian\nbecame aware that the applicant had also been the subject\nof several\ninvestigations into her alleged conduct as a foster carer. Some of the alleged\nconduct investigated had been the subject\nof the 2019 Criminal Trial involving\nthe complainant. Other alleged conduct concerned other children in the\napplicant’s care.\nThe investigations were variously conducted by the\nDepartment of Community and Justice (“**DCJ**”), previously known\nas the Department of Family and Community Services (“**FACS**”)\nand the Department of Community Services (“**DOCS**”), as well as\nan accredited foster care agency, Wesley Mission Dalmar (“**Wesley\nDalmar**” or “**WD**” ).\n9. As\na general overview of the outcomes of the government agency investigations, we\nnote that:\n\t* (1) allegations\n\tin 4 investigations were not sustained and there were no adverse findings or\n\tdirections against the applicant;\n\t* (2) allegations\n\tin another 4 investigations were sustained (although one allegation was\n\tsustained in error and was not relied upon\n\tby the respondent in these\n\tproceedings), but with no adverse findings or directions against the applicant.\n\tOne of the investigations\n\tundertaken in late 2015 by Wesley Dalmar resulted in\n\tthe Department of Education (“**DoE**”) issuing a direction to\n\tthe applicant. However, the DoE did not make findings because of a dispute as to\n\tthe sufficiency of\n\tevidence and the quality of the investigation;\n\t* (3) an\n\tinvestigation by Wesley Dalmar in 2021 concerning 11 allegations resulted in\n\tnon-adverse findings with respect to 9 allegations\n\tand adverse findings with\n\trespect to 2 allegations.\n10. After\ncompleting the risk assessment, the applicant was notified in writing on 9 March\n2022 that, pursuant to s 18(2) of the Act,\nthe Children’s Guardian\nproposed to refuse her application for clearance.\n11. On\n5 April 2022, the Children’s Guardian informed the applicant that she had\nbeen refused a clearance.\n12. In\nsupport of her application, the applicant argued that she had not been convicted\nwith respect to any of the criminal charges laid\nagainst her in the 2019\nCriminal Trial. She contended that she did not commit any offence against the\ncomplainant and she did not\nengage in the alleged conduct the subject of the\ninvestigations by DOCS, FACS, DCJ, Wesley Dalmar or the DoE. The applicant\nsubmitted\nthat she presents no risk to the safety of children, that a reasonable\nperson would allow their child to have direct contact with\nher (without being\ndirectly supervised by another person), and that it is in the public interest to\ngrant her a clearance.\n13. The\napplicant sought orders that the Tribunal set aside the Refusal Decision and\ndirect the Children’s Guardian to issue her\nwith a clearance.\n14. The\nrespondent maintained its position, arguing that the applicant posed a real and\nappreciable risk to the safety of children, and\nsought orders to have the\nRefusal Decision affirmed and the application dismissed.\n15. On\nthe evidence before us, we have decided that the correct and preferable decision\nis to affirm the Children’s Guardian’s\nRefusal Decision, and these\nare our reasons.\n\n*Prohibition order*\n\n\n1. Due\nto the sensitive nature of these proceedings and to protect against the identity\nof an alleged victim being disclosed, an order\nwas made on 2 June 2022 pursuant\nto [s 64(1)(a)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caata2013326/s64.html) of the *[Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caata2013326/)* (NSW)\n(“**NCAT Act**”) that the publication or broadcast of the name of\nany person mentioned in these proceedings or referred to in the documentary\nmaterial lodged in these proceedings is prohibited. The order was subsequently\namended on 6 September 2022, the effect of which is\nthat the pseudonym\n‘FKZ’ (superseding the previous pseudonym ‘FJE’) is to\nbe used for the applicant’s\nname in these proceedings. To protect the\nidentity of the applicant and any complainant or alleged victim, we have not\ndisclosed\nthe names of schools and teachers where children in the\napplicant’s care attended or the precise dates on which the 2019 Criminal\nTrial took place.\n\n**Material and evidence before the\nTribunal**\n\n\n1. The\nfollowing material was filed on behalf of the applicant:\n\t* (1) application\n\tfor administrative review filed on 12 April 2022 annexing a copy of the Refusal\n\tDecision;\n\t* (2) an affidavit\n\tmade by the applicant on 23 September 2022 (marked for identification\n\t“Exhibit A1”);\n\t* (3) an affidavit\n\tmade on 23 September 2022 by Christopher Wozniak, the applicant’s\n\tsolicitor, annexing a copy of the report\n\tdated 20 September 2022 prepared by Dr\n\tRichard Furst, Forensic Psychiatrist (marked for identification “Exhibit\n\tA2”);\n\t* (4) an affidavit\n\tof Christopher Wozniak dated 7 November 2022 annexing transcripts of interviews\n\tconducted on 21 February 2019 by\n\tthe New South Wales Police with three children\n\twho were in the care of the Applicant (marked for identification “Exhibit\n\tA3”);\n\t* (5) an affidavit\n\tmade by the applicant on 14 February 2023 (marked for identification\n\t“Exhibit A4”);\n\t* (6) Outline of\n\tSubmissions filed on 1 March 2023.\n2. The\nfollowing material was filed on behalf of the respondent:\n\t* (1) Evidence\n\tBundle filed on 7 October 2022 (marked for identification “Exhibit\n\tR1”);\n\t* (2) documents\n\tproduced by Dr Furst in response to a Summons to Produce issued by the Tribunal\n\ton 7 October 2022 (marked for identification\n\t“Exhibit R2”);\n\t* (3) Supplementary\n\tEvidence Bundle filed on 21 February 2023 (marked for identification\n\t“Exhibit R3”);\n\t* (4) Submissions\n\tdated 2 February 2023.\n\n*Oral evidence*\n\n\n1. The\napplicant and Dr Furst were cross-examined during the\nhearing.\n\n**Background**\n\n\n*The applicant’s family and employment history*\n\n\n1. The\napplicant is 55 years of age and has been in a long term marriage for almost 33\nyears. She has two biological adult sons and one\ngrandchild, and is the adoptive\nmother of another son aged 22 (“**Child C**”).\n2. She\nworked as an authorised foster carer from July 2003 until March 2019 when her\nclearance was cancelled. Initially, she worked as\na carer with FACS and then, in\naround August 2014, she provided foster care through Wesley Dalmar. As an\nauthorised carer, she and\nher husband provided foster care services to around\n120 children. Some foster placements were short term (overnight or weekly) and\nothers were for longer terms.\n3. Child\nC first came into her care in 2004 and was subsequently adopted by the applicant\nand her husband in 2014.\n4. Another\nchild (“**Child T**”) was placed in the applicant’s care in\nNovember 2004 and remained so until February 2006.\n5. Three\nsiblings from another family (referred to in these reasons as “**Child\n1**”, “**Child 2**” and “**Child 3**”)\nwere subsequently placed with the applicant on a long term basis as set out\nbelow:\n\t* (1) Child 1, at\n\tthe age of 3, was placed with the applicant in February 2007. He remained in the\n\tapplicant’s care for around\n\t7 years and 4 months until she asked FACS to\n\tremove him in June 2014. The applicant believed the child was making false,\n\tserious\n\tallegations of a sexual nature about a neighbour and the Acting\n\tPrincipal of the school the child attended at the time. The allegations\n\twere\n\tinvestigated by the Joint Response Unit (comprising community services, NSW\n\tPolice and NSW Health personnel) (“**the JRU**”) and were found\n\tto be a fabrication. The applicant decided she could no longer care for him,\n\tgiven his sexualised behaviours\n\tand the false allegations of sexual conduct he\n\twas making about other people;\n\t* (2) Child 2, the\n\ttwin sister of Child 1, was also placed (at the age of 3) with the applicant in\n\tFebruary 2007. Her placement lasted\n\tlonger, for around 8 years and 9 months. She\n\tremained in the applicant’s care for another 17 months after Child 1 was\n\tmoved\n\tto another placement. In November 2015, Wesley Dalmar determined that\n\tChild 2 was at risk of sexual and psychological harm by the\n\tapplicant’s\n\tadopted son whilst in a placement with the applicant, and moved her to another\n\tplacement;\n\t* (3) Child 3, the\n\tyounger brother of the twins, was placed with the applicant in July 2007 when he\n\twas two days old. He remained in\n\ther care for longer than his older twin\n\tsiblings, for around 11 years and 8 months. He was moved to another placement in\n\tMarch 2019\n\twhen the applicant was charged with the alleged criminal offences\n\tagainst Child 1, and Wesley Dalmar was also considering allegations\n\tagainst the\n\tapplicant that she had sexually harmed this younger child.\n6. As\nwell as raising her two biological sons, and having the care of her adopted son\nand the three siblings, we understand the applicant\ncontemporaneously cared for\nsix other foster children at varying times and for varying periods of time.\nAlthough the lengths of placements\nfor those six other children were not\nidentified, it is assumed that they were not on a short term basis, given the\napplicant’s\nevidence that she cared for around 120 children.\n7. Additionally,\nthe applicant worked with the DoE from May 1993 until March 2019. She worked\npart-time three days per week when the\ntwins were placed with her and then\nstopped working with the DoE when Child 3 arrived until he was around 3 years\nold. Initially,\nshe was employed as a Special Needs Officer and then as a School\nLearning Support Officer (otherwise known as a Teacher’s Aide).\nIn her\nestimation, the applicant worked with more than two thousand children aged 4 to\n18 in her capacity as a Teacher’s Aide.\n\n*Medical and\npsychological assessments of children in the applicant’s care*\n\n\n**Child C (subsequently adopted)**\n\n\n1. According\nto the applicant’s own evidence, her adopted son has a rare genetic\ncondition called 7q11.23 syndrome which has affected\nhis development. The\napplicant believed that the child’s intellectual development was many\nyears below his chronological age,\nsuch that his development when he was 14\nyears of age was equivalent to that of a 7 year old. In her assessment, this\nchild struggled\nwith literacy, meeting social norms and making mature\ndecisions.\n\n**Child 1**\n\n\n1. Child\n1 suffered horrific sexual abuse from his biological parents. His father was a\nknown sexual offender of children, including\nhis own. His mother had been\ncharged with criminal neglect. He was removed from his birth parents due to\nissues of physical and sexual\nabuse, and neglect.\n2. Various\nreports noted that the child has mild to moderate intellectual delay and that he\nexperienced bowel incontinence as a result\nof the sexual abuse he suffered. Due\nto his involuntary soiling issue which continued until the time when he was\nenrolled in primary\nschool, he wore pull-up nappies at night. He demonstrated\nage-inappropriate sexualised behaviours, which included approaching strangers\nto\nengage in sexual activities.\n3. In\n2011 and 2012, he had IQ assessments and was authorised for IM support class\nplacement. In 2013, a review by a clinical geneticist\nsuggested he had Aarskog\nsyndrome. In 2015, he had moderate impaired language skills. In May 2018, a\nconsultant paediatrician reported\nthat the child (then aged 14) had intellectual\ndisability, dysmorphism and persistent iron deficiency anaemia. In a writing\ntest,\nhe wrote a short sentence at about a grade 2 level. The paediatrician\nnoted that the child could maintain a simple ‘to and\nfro’\nconversation. He was reported to be socially naïve and required\nassistance/supervision to negotiate interactions,\nsometimes resulting in\nnegative outcomes.\n4. In\nAugust 2018, at the age of nearly 15, Child 1 was re-examined by the clinical\ngeneticist who noted that the child was experiencing\na good appetite, normal\nbowel motions and normal sleep. He thought that the child had mild to moderate\nintellectual disability because\nhe struggled to read and write properly. At the\ntime of re-examination, the correctness of the previous suspected diagnosis of\nAarskog\nsyndrome was queried because the child had started to grow quite\nsignificantly and no longer had a short stature.\n5. In\nJune 2021, drawing from the medical diagnoses, Wesley Dalmar’s assessment\nof the child found him to be socially naive requiring\nassistance or supervision\nwith his interactions which sometimes resulted in negative outcomes. His\nvulnerability was assessed at\nthat time as being moderate, and professional\ntherapeutic intervention was recommended to treat his experience living in the\nplacement\nwith the applicant.\n\n**Child 2**\n\n\n1. Child\n2, likewise, had suffered sexual and physical abuse from her birth parents\n(although to a lesser extent than Child 1) and was\nremoved for the same reasons.\nShe has been variously described as being competent, articulate and well-spoken.\nHowever, this child\nrepeatedly demonstrated an inability to discuss any abuse\ncaused to her by her birth parents, or any abuse that she may have suffered\nat\nthe hands of any siblings, the applicant or members of the applicant’s\nhousehold. Her vulnerability was assessed by Wesley\nDalmar in July 2021 as being\nmoderate and she was also recommended for professional therapeutic\nintervention.\n\n**Child 3**\n\n\n1. Child\n3 was removed from his birth parents when he was born and thus was not exposed\nto sexual or physical assault by them. At the\nage of around 11, he was examined\nby a consultant paediatrician and a paediatric neurologist. A report in August\n2018 from the paediatrician\nto the Wesley Dalmar Caseworker noted that the child\nsuffered with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and depression,\nand that he was medicated to treat those conditions. He was also receiving\nmedication at night to help him sleep. His behaviour was\ndescribed as good,\nalthough he appeared to be more withdrawn, and the report obliquely referred to\na proposed adoption, noting there\nwere some concerns regarding such a course of\naction. A paediatric neurologist in October 2018 noted that this child was\nreceiving\nmedication for his ADHD and anxiety.\n2. In\nits risk assessment in July 2021, Wesley Dalmar noted that the child had been\ndiagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, sleeping disorder,\nincontinence and\nexpressive/receptive language delays. He too, demonstrated an inability to\ndiscuss negative experiences during his\nplacement with the applicant. He wanted\nto return to the placement with the applicant and was cautious about saying\nanything in a\nformal setting, often denying disclosures he had previously made\nor incidents that had been reported. His vulnerability was assessed\nas being\nmoderate, with the severity of harm classed as major.\n\n*Reasons for\nseeking a clearance*\n\n\n1. Since\nhaving her previous clearance cancelled, the applicant has been employed in the\ndisability sector, as a carer for adults with\ndisabilities. Dr Furst’s\nreport noted that her work involves helping people as a job coach/on-site\nsupport person.\n2. The\napplicant requires a clearance in order to return to employment as a\nTeacher’s Aide in special education, provide services\nas an authorised\ncarer, have Child 3 (whom we note is now almost 16) returned to her care, and\nprovide coaching in baseball and soccer.\n3. In\nher written submission to the Children’s Guardian, the applicant stated\nthat she is $110,000 ‘out of pocket’\nand we understand this amount\nrepresents costs incurred in connection with criminal proceedings and the loss\nof her previous employment.\nWe understand this is also a motivating factor for\nthe application.\n\n**Disclosures made by Child 1 after leaving his\nplacement with the applicant**\n\n\n1. The\n2019 Criminal Trial arose from a series of disclosures made by Child 1 after\nleaving his placement with the applicant in June\n2014. He then appears to have\nbeen in various care arrangements for 3 years before being placed with a Wesley\nDalmar foster carer\nin June 2017. For ease of reference, we draw from the\nJudgment of the presiding Magistrate in the 2019 Criminal Trial\n(“**the** **Judgment**”) to identify the various disclosures\nmade by the child and the sequence in which those disclosures were made.\n2. His\nfirst disclosure appears to have been to Ms Dins Bose, a Caseworker with FACS,\non 5 December 2014, who asked him what he liked\nabout his new placement. This\nwas around 6 months after leaving the care of the applicant. He responded by\nsaying that at least he\nwasn’t hit in the new placement, and that the\napplicant used to hit him all the time, every day, with her husband’s\nbelt.\n3. Ms\nBose interviewed him on 26 February 2016. He repeated his allegation that the\napplicant had hit him with a belt and added a new\nallegation, that she had\nsprayed Glen20 into his mouth.\n4. In\nMay 2018, almost four years after ceasing to live with the applicant, the child\nwas reported as having nightmares and screaming\nin his sleep. The Wesley Dalmar\ncarer informed the Caseworker allocated to monitoring the child’s progress\nthat he had disclosed\nto the carer that the applicant had encouraged his younger\nbrother (Child 3) to hit him over the head with a rake and that the applicant\nhad broken a plastic plate over his head.\n5. The\nCaseworker subsequently interviewed the child on 26 October 2018 during which he\nrepeated his allegations that he had been hit\nby a belt, had Glen20 sprayed into\nhis mouth, had been hit on the head with a rake and had plastic plates smashed\non his head. His\ndisclosures included other allegations and they are set out\nbelow:\n\t* (1) “they”\n\tsprayed Glen 20 into his mouth;\n\t* (2) “they”\n\tmade him lick his blood off the kitchen sink (the reference to\n\t“they” was a reference to one of\n\tthe applicant’s biological\n\tsons);\n\t* (3) he was hit\n\twith a belt;\n\t* (4) “they”\n\ttold him and his twin sister to sit on the stairs;\n\t* (5) his younger\n\tbrother was told by the applicant and her husband to hit him (Child 1) on the\n\thead with a rake;\n\t* (6) he had\n\tplastic plates smashed on his head;\n\t* (7) he was made\n\tto wet himself and forced to change in a carpark;\n\t* (8) Child C had\n\ttouched Child 1 rudely;\n\t* (9) Child C did\n\trude things with no clothes on, including jumping on Child 1 in\n\tbed.\n6. A\nmonth later, on 27 November 2018, Child 1 made a further disclosure to the\nCaseworker that the applicant had put faeces on his toothbrush\nand had brushed\nhis teeth with it.\n7. On\n19 December 2018, the Caseworker interviewed Child 1 to clarify the\ntoothbrushing incident and, in the course of that interview,\nhe made a further\ndisclosure that the applicant had made him touch her vagina.\n8. On\n21 February 2019, Child 1 participated in a recorded interview at the Penrith\nChild Abuse Unit. He was asked questions about the\nallegations he had made. The\ntranscript of this recorded interview formed his evidence-in-chief in the 2019\nCriminal Trial.\n\n**Charges and proceedings precipitating the\nrespondent’s risk assessment**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant’s conduct was alleged to have taken place at her home. The\ncharges as described in the Court Attendance Notice\nare set out below (noting\nthere appears to have been errors made in relation to the dates with respect to\ncharges sequenced (5) and\n(6) because Child 1 left the care of the applicant in\nJune 2014):\n\t* (1) Common\n\tassault (under [s 61](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s61.html) of the [Crimes Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/)) between 1 January 2013 and 31 December\n\t2013, particularised as the applicant forcing Child 1’s mouth open and\n\tspraying Glen\n\t20 into it (“**the Glen 20 Allegation**”);\n\t* (2) Common\n\tassault (under [s 61](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s61.html) of the [Crimes Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/)) between 1 January 2013 and 31 December\n\t2013, particularised as the applicant smashing a plate over Child 1’s head\n\t(“**the Kitchen Plate Allegation**”);\n\t* (3) Common\n\tassault (under [s 61](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s61.html) of the [Crimes Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/)) between 1 January 2014 and 31 December\n\t2014, particularised as Child 1 being struck by a belt across his buttocks\n\t(“**the Belt Allegation**”);\n\t* (4) Indecent\n\tassault person under the age of 16 years (under s 61M(2) of the [Crimes Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/))\n\tbetween 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2014, particularised as the applicant\n\ttaking Child 1’s hand whilst he was sitting in\n\ta bath and placing it on\n\tthe outside of the applicant’s vagina (“**the Indecent Assault\n\tAllegation**”);\n\t* (5) Common\n\tassault (under [s 61](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s61.html) of the [Crimes Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/)) between 1 January 2015 and 31 December\n\t2015, particularised as the applicant pushing Child 1’s head into a toilet\n\tbowl and\n\tthen flushing it (“**the Toilet Allegation**”);\n\t* (6) Common\n\tassault (under [s 61](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s61.html) of the [Crimes Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/)) between 1 January 2015 and 31 December\n\t2015, particularised as the applicant using a toothbrush to scrape faeces from\n\tChild 1’s\n\tbottom whilst he was in the shower and then brushing his teeth\n\twith it (“**the Shower Toothbrush Allegation**”).\n2. The\ntrial took place over three days in 2020 in the Parramatta Local Court, with His\nHonour’s reasons handed down in March 2021.\nChild 1 was cross-examined on\nhis evidence-in-chief. Witness evidence included that given by two teachers, the\nWesley Dalmar Caseworker,\nMs Bins, and the Wesley Dalmar foster carer. The\napplicant was cross-examined and denied all the allegations.\n3. Child\n1 was found to be a credible witness but after weighing the evidence as a whole,\nHis Honour could not conclude that the prosecution\ncase had eliminated all\nreasonable doubt as to the guilt of the applicant. All charges were therefore\ndismissed.\n\n**Government agency investigations into various\nallegations**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant has been the subject of nine investigations into her alleged conduct\nas a foster carer. The table below identifies,\nat a high level, the various\ninvestigations undertaken and their\nfindings:\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Investigation** | **Date** | **Allegation** | **Agency** | **Finding(s)** |\n| First | 2006 | Physical harm to Child T and Child C | DOCS | **Not** sustained\nNo adverse findings or directions against the applicant |\n| Second | Early 2014 | Excessive disciplining of Child 1 and another child | FACS | **Not** sustained\nNo adverse findings or directions against the applicant |\n| Third | Sep & Oct 2015 | Sexualised behaviour of Child C toward Child 1 and Child 2 | FACS | **Not** sustained\nNo adverse findings or directions against the applicant however Child 2 was\nfound to be at risk of sexual and psychological harm by\nChild C and a safety\nplan was implemented to protect her. |\n| Fourth | Late 2015 and 2016 | Inappropriate disciplining of Child 1 | Wesley Dalmar (in this table, “WD”) and then DoE | **Sustained** (by WD)\nNo adverse findings or directions by WD but subsequent investigation by DoE\nresulted in a direction to the applicant in 2018 |\n| Fifth | 2016 | Contact facilitated between Child 1, Child 2, Child 3 and Child C alleged\nto be contrary to a safety plan  | FACS | **Sustained** **in error** and Wesley Dalmar conceded it had made a\nmistake and had encouraged the contact visit, and there were no adverse\ndirections against\nthe applicant. |\n| Sixth | 2016 | Withholding food as punishment of Child 1 | WD | **Sustained** but no action taken |\n| Seventh | 2019 | Applicant’s husband showering with Child 3 | FACS | **Not** sustained\nNo adverse findings or directions against the applicant |\n| Eighth | 2021 | Allegations that were the subject of the 2019 Criminal Trial | DCJ/FACS | **Sustained** |\n| Ninth | 2021 | Eleven allegations including those the subject of the 2019 Criminal\nTrial | WD | **Not** sustained and no adverse findings with respect to nine\nallegations\n**Sustained** with adverse findings in relation to two allegations |\n\n\n**The Refusal Decision**\n\n\n1. The\nRefusal Decision issued on 5 April 2022 set out the reasons why, after\ncompleting the risk assessment, the respondent was satisfied\nthat the applicant\nposes a risk to the safety of children and refused to grant a clearance. As a\npoint of reference in recording\nthe history of this case, we summarise our\nunderstanding of the reasoning in the Refusal Decision. In doing so, we do not\npresume\nor confirm the correctness of that decision.\n2. From\na threshold position, the Children’s Guardian noted that children in\nfoster care are amongst the most vulnerable children\nin the community and\nconsidered that the seriousness of the allegations was increased because of the\napplicant’s status as\na foster carer.\n3. The\nChildren’s Guardian took into account a number of matters in the\napplicant’s favour including:\n\t* (1) her not\n\tinsignificant 27 years of good conduct in child related employment with the\n\tDoE;\n\t* (2) her denial\n\tof the allegations and submissions that Child 1 had made allegations about other\n\tpeople;\n\t* (3) multiple\n\tpersonal character references supporting her application for clearance and\n\tcommenting favourably on her conduct with\n\tchildren;\n\t* (4) that Child 1\n\tdid not wish to provide a formal interview regarding allegations that the\n\tapplicant’s adopted son (Child C)\n\thad indecently assaulted him, and told\n\tpolice in that interview that he was safe;\n\t* (5) the\n\tdifficult behaviours of Child 1 and Child 2 due to their history of\n\tneglect.\n4. In\nthe respondent’s overall assessment, the applicant posed a real and\nappreciable risk to the safety of children on the grounds\nthat:\n\t* (1) the\n\tallegations described sexual harm and cruel and unusual punishments toward\n\tsignificantly vulnerable children;\n\t* (2) the\n\tsimilarity of harm described by unrelated children and adults increased the\n\tcredibility of the various disclosures against\n\tthe applicant;\n\t* (3) it is likely\n\tthat any child exposed to the alleged conduct would experience severe and\n\tenduring harm. Child 1 and Child 2 were\n\tparticularly vulnerable because of their\n\tchildhood experiences of abuse and the disabilities of Child 1 rendered the\n\tallegations\n\tof the utmost seriousness;\n\t* (4) whilst\n\tacknowledging the applicant’s denial of the allegations tried in the\n\tParramatta Local Court, weight was given to\n\tHis Honour’s assessment of\n\tChild 1 as being a credible witness, and the respondent was not satisfied that\n\tabuse did not occur\n\tand held the view that it was reasonably likely the conduct\n\toccurred as alleged;\n\t* (5) the\n\tapplicant’s criminal history of assault against an adult woman in a public\n\tvenue in 2016 (in relation to which she pleaded\n\tguilty) strongly suggested that\n\tshe has difficulty managing her behaviour when her emotions are heightened,\n\tincluding in the presence\n\tof children, and that this history gave support to the\n\tview that the applicant has a tendency to engage in behaviours that place\n\tchildren at risk;\n\t* (6) the\n\tallegations described an enduring pattern of behaviour over an extended period\n\tof time despite directions from the applicant’s\n\temployer and restrictions\n\ton her carer authorisation, and there was no information that she had engaged in\n\tcounselling, professional\n\tdevelopment, training or remedial action to address\n\tconcerns about the alleged conduct. As such, the respondent concluded there was\n\ta risk the applicant’s behaviour would continue to be repeated;\n\t* (7) repetition\n\tof the alleged conduct would place any child exposed at risk of severe and\n\tenduring harm.\n\n**Expert psychological opinion**\n\n\n1. Dr\nFurst provided his opinion on the risk of the applicant to the safety of\nchildren and the likelihood of the applicant engaging\nin future in the conduct\nthe subject of the 2019 Criminal Trial.\n2. Dr\nFurst’s assessment report was based on a consultation with the applicant\nvia an AVL link for 90 minutes and various documents\nincluding:\n\t* (1) a letter of\n\tinstruction from the applicant’s solicitor setting out various factual\n\tmatters including that the applicant\n\thad been charged with common assault of an\n\tadult in 2016;\n\t* (2) Court\n\tAttendance Notice and NSW Police Facts relating to the 2019 Criminal Trial;\n\t* (3) the\n\tJudgment;\n\t* (4) the\n\tapplicant’s Curriculum Vitae;\n\t* (5) the\n\tapplicant’s application and submission to the Children’s Guardian\n\tfor a working with children check clearance\n\tand references in support of her\n\tapplication; and\n\t* (6) the\n\trespondent’s Proposed Refusal Letter and Refusal Decision.\n3. Dr\nFurst obtained an account directly from the applicant about her family\nbackground and general demographics, her employment history\nand that of her\nhusband, as well as her psychiatric and medical history.\n4. Dr\nFurst noted that common risk assessment tools including the Violence Risk\nAppraisal Guide (VRAG), the Violence Risk Scale (VRS),\nthe HCR-20 (Version 3)\nand the Level of Service Inventory – Revised (LSI-R) provide a useful\nguide in relation to an individual\nperson’s risk of future offending\nhowever they are far from precise and have limitations in relation to the\naccurate prediction\nof human behaviour.\n5. The\nexpert identified the static (background) and dynamic (current) risk factors in\nthe recognised literature, and the protective\nfactors that can reduce the\nlikelihood of a person engaging in future offending.\n6. Based\nupon his review of the available history and documentation, and the information\nthat the applicant provided to him, Dr Furst\nthought that the applicant did not\npose any real or appreciable risk to the safety of children.\n7. Overall,\nbased on the applicant’s static and dynamic risk factors, and protective\nfactors, Dr Furst opined that the applicant\nposed a very low risk of committing\nthe types of offences that she was charged with in the 2019 Criminal Trial.\n8. During\ncross-examination, Dr Furst expanded upon and clarified his report. His opinion\nand oral evidence are further discussed in\nthese reasons under\n“Consideration”.\n\n**Applicable legislation and legal\nprinciples**\n\n\n*Protective jurisdiction of the Act*\n\n\n1. The\nprotective jurisdiction of the Act is plainly evident from its stated object as\nset out in s 3:\n\n\n\n> \n> **3 Object of Act**\n> The object of this Act is to protect children—\n> \n> \n> (a) by not permitting certain persons to engage in child-related work, and\n> \n> \n> (b) by requiring persons engaged in child-related work to have working with\n> children check clearances.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n*Paramount consideration*\n\n\n1. The\nparamount consideration in the operation of the Act is set out in s 4:\n\n\n\n> \n> **4 Safety, welfare and well-being of children to be paramount\n> consideration**\n> The safety, welfare and well-being of children and, in particular, protecting\n> them from child abuse, is the paramount consideration\n> in the operation of this\n> Act.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n1. Having\nregard to that paramount consideration, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under s\n27 of the Act is protective, and not punitive,\nin nature: *DAI v\nChildren’s Guardian* [[2017] NSWCATAD 308](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2017/308.html \"View Case\") at [[8]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2017/308.html#para8) (*DAI*); *AYU v\nNSW Office of the Children’s Guardian* [[2014] NSWCATAD 69](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/69.html \"View Case\") at [[34]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/69.html#para34)\n(*AYU*); *Commissioner for Children and Young People v FZ* [[2011]\nNSWCA 111](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2011/111.html \"View Case\"), per Young JA at [61]. The object of the Act is not to impose\nadditional punishment on a person such as the applicant, but to eliminate\npossible risks to children: *CYY v Children’s Guardian (No 2)* [[2017]\nNSWCATAD 262](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2017/262.html \"View Case\") (*CYY*) at [26]; *AYU* at [34].\n\n*Test\nto be satisfied that a person is not a risk to the safety of children*\n\n\n1. Under\ns 18(2) of the Act, the Children’s Guardian must grant a clearance to a\nperson who is subject to a risk assessment unless\nit is satisfied that the\nperson poses a risk to the safety of children.\n\n*Definition of\n“children” and the meaning of “risk to the safety of\nchildren”*\n\n\n1. “Children”\nis defined in s 5(1) of the Act to mean “persons under the age of 18\nyears”.\n2. The\nmeaning of “risk to the safety of children” is defined in s 5B of\nthe Act to mean a “real and appreciable risk\nto the safety of\nchildren.” The meaning of the word ‘risk’ was considered by\nYoung CJ (in Equity) in *Commission for Children and Young People v V*\n[[2002] NSWSC 949](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/949.html \"View Case\"); [56 NSWLR 476](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=56%20NSWLR%20476 \"View LawCiteRecord\") at [[42]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/949.html#para42):\n\n\n\n> \n> “One does not define risk as meaning minimal risk.

His\nHonour’s consideration of the meaning of risk was cited with approval in a\nnumber of cases before the Tribunal and the NSW\nSupreme Court: *CTE v\nChildren’s Guardian* [[2018] NSWCATAD 28](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2018/28.html \"View Case\") at [[30]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2018/28.html#para30); *BKE v Office of\nChildren’s Guardian*  [[2015] NSWSC 523](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2015/523.html \"View Case\") (*BKE*) at [26] and\n*AYU* at [39]. Ultimately, the Tribunal must consider whether a clearance,\nif granted, will create a “real and not fanciful”\nrisk to the safety\nof children: *CXZ v Children’s Guardian*  [[2020] NSWCA 338](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2020/338.html \"View Case\")\n(*CXZ*) per Basten JA at [26].\n\n*Child-related work requires a\nWWCC clearance*\n\n\n1. The\nmeaning of “child-related work” is set out in s 6 of the Act. Work\nthat is referred to in s 6(2) of the Act that involves\ndirect contact by a\nworker with a child or children and that contact is a usual part of and more\nthan incidental to the work is defined\nas “child-related work” for\nthe purposes of the Act.\n\n*Mandatory risk assessment triggered by\nSchedule 1 matters*\n\n\n1. A\nperson is subject to an assessment requirement under the Act if any of the\nmatters specified in Schedule 1 of the Act apply to the\nperson: s 14 of the Act.\nIn this matter, the applicant was charged with the offences discussed above and\naccordingly, it was necessary\nfor the Children’s Guardian to undertake a\nrisk assessment, guided by the provisions of s 15(4) of the Act, to determine\nwhether\nshe posed a risk to the safety of children.\n2. Further,\nunder s 15(4A) of the Act, the Children’s Guardian must not determine that\nan applicant does not pose a risk to the\nsafety of children unless it is\nsatisfied that the ‘reasonable person’ and ‘public\ninterest’ tests are met:\n\n\n\n> \n> (a) a reasonable person would allow his or her child to have direct contact with\n> the applicant that was not directly supervised by\n> another person while the\n> applicant was engaged in any child-related work, and\n> (b) it is in the public interest to make the determination.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n*Issue for the Tribunal’s determination*\n\n\n1. The\nissue for determination by the Tribunal is whether, applying the test in s 18(2)\nof the Act, it is satisfied that the applicant\ndoes not pose a risk to the\nsafety of children.\n2. Under\n[s 63(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/adra1997335/s63.html) of the *[Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/adra1997335/)* (NSW)\n(“**the** **ADR Act**”), the Tribunal must determine the\n“correct and preferable” decision (whether the applicant poses a\nreal and appreciable\nrisk to the safety of children) with regard to the material\nbefore it, including material that may not have been before the respondent,\nand\nthe applicable law: s 63(1) of the; *YG & GG v Minister for Community\nServices* [[2002] NSWCA 247](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2002/247.html \"View Case\") at [[25]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2002/247.html#para25), per Hodgson JA (with whom Foster and\nBrownie A-JJA agreed); applied in *BHY v Children’s Guardian* [[2015]\nNSWCATAD 91](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2015/91.html \"View Case\") at [[14]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2015/91.html#para14).\n3. Subsection\n63(2) of the ADR Act allows the Tribunal, for the purpose of determining an\napplication, to exercise all of the functions\nthat are conferred or imposed by\nany relevant legislation on the administrator who made the decision.\n4. In\ndetermining an application, understanding the effect of ss 63(1) and 63(2) of\nthe ADR Act, the Tribunal must not simply “stand\nin the shoes” of an\nadministrator. As explained in *DYH v Public Guardian* [[2021] NSWCATAD 136](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2021/136.html \"View Case\")\nat [[21]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2021/136.html#para21), the Tribunal must conduct its review without any presumption as to the\ncorrectness of an administrator’s decision:\n\n\n\n> \n> “The effect of these two subsections is sometimes characterised as the\n> Tribunal being required to “stand in the shoes”\n> of the administrator\n> who made the decision.

The\nTribunal may make orders that include an order to affirm the Refusal Decision or\nvary it, or set it aside and make a decision\nin substitution, or set it aside\nand remit the matter to the respondent for reconsideration: s 63(3) of the ADR\nAct.\n\n*Mandatory considerations under s 30(1) of the Act*\n\n\n1. In\ndetermining this application, the Tribunal must consider the matters set out in\ns 30(1) as set out below:\n\n\n\n> \n> **30 Determination of applications and other matters**\n> (1) The Tribunal must consider the following in determining an application under\n> this Part—\n> \n> \n> (a) the seriousness of the offences with respect to which the person is a\n> disqualified person or any matters that caused a refusal\n> of a clearance or\n> imposition of an interim bar,\n> \n> \n> (b) the period of time since those offences or matters occurred and the conduct\n> of the person since they occurred,\n> \n> \n> (c) the age of the person at the time the offences or matters occurred,\n> \n> \n> (d) the age of each victim of any relevant offence or conduct at the time they\n> occurred and any matters relating to the vulnerability\n> of the victim,\n> \n> \n> (e) the difference in age between the victim and the person and the relationship\n> (if any) between the victim and the person,\n> \n> \n> (f) whether the person knew, or could reasonably have known, that the victim was\n> a child,\n> \n> \n> (g) the person’s present age,\n> \n> \n> (h) the seriousness of the person’s criminal history and the conduct of\n> the person since the matters occurred,\n> \n> \n> (i) the likelihood of any repetition by the person of the offences or conduct\n> and the impact on children of any such repetition,\n> \n> \n> (i1) any order of a court or tribunal that is in force in relation to the\n> person,\n> \n> \n> (j) any information given by the applicant in, or in relation to, the\n> application,\n> \n> \n> (j1) any relevant information in relation to the person that was obtained in\n> accordance with section 36A,\n> \n> \n> (k) any other matters that the Children’s Guardian considers necessary.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n*Further considerations under s 30(1A) of the Act*\n\n\n1. In\naddition, if the Tribunal is considering making an order enabling an applicant\nto work with children, it must then consider the\ntwo-part test set out in s\n30(1A) of the Act:\n\n\n\n> \n> (1A) The Tribunal may not make an order under this Part which has the effect of\n> enabling a person (the affected person) to work with\n> children in accordance\n> with this Act unless the Tribunal is satisfied that—\n> (a) a reasonable person would allow his or her child to have direct contact with\n> the affected person that was not directly supervised\n> by another person while the\n> affected person was engaged in any child-related work, and\n> \n> \n> (b) it is in the public interest to make the order.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n**First limb of the two-part test under s 30(1A)(a) - the “reasonable\nperson” test**\n\n\n1. The\nfirst limb of the two-part test is known as the “reasonable person”\ntest. It requires the application of an objective\nstandard based upon the views\nof the “reasonable person”. It assumes that the “reasonable\nperson” is acquainted\nwith all the relevant facts of which the Tribunal is\naware: *CHB v Children’s Guardian* [[2016] NSWCATAD 214](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2016/214.html \"View Case\") at [[127]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2016/214.html#para127);\n*CYY* at [26].\n2. The\nlegislation in Victoria contains provisions similar to those in s 30(1A) of the\nAct. In *VQB v The Secretary to the Department of Justice (Review and\nRegulation)* [[2013] VCAT 789](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/vic/VCAT/2013/789.html \"View Case\") at [[36]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/vic/VCAT/2013/789.html#para36) (*VQB*), the Tribunal held that an\nobjective test was called for by the legislation:\n\n\n\n> \n> “... The reasonable person would, in reaching his or her conclusions,\n> acquaint himself or herself with all of the matters that\n> have been placed before\n> me, giving an applicant for a positive assessment a right to be heard, as well\n> as considering the material\n> gathered by the Secretary. A reasonable person would\n> not approach the task with a closed mind, thinking that once a person has\n> offended,\n> he or she can never be redeemed. The reasonable person, however, would\n> not put aside all scepticism and reasonable caution in this\n> most difficult area\n> in some over-optimistic attempt to facilitate rehabilitation.”\n> \n\n\n1. The\nreasonable person approach taken in *VQB* was endorsed in NSW in *CRG v\nChildren’s Guardian* [[2017] NSWCATAD 295](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2017/295.html \"View Case\") at [[85]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2017/295.html#para85) and *DAI* at\n[90]. In *DAI* at [91], the Tribunal said:\n\n\n\n> \n> “In order to properly consider this test, a ‘reasonable\n> person’ would need to know about the disqualifying offence,\n> the\n> circumstances surrounding the offence, the applicant’s entire criminal\n> history, the length of time since those offences\n> occurred, his conduct since\n> then and any expert assessment made for him.” \n> \n\n\n**Second limb of the two-part test under s 30(1)(b) - the “public\ninterest” test**\n\n\n1. The\nsecond limb of the two-part test is referred to as the “public\ninterest” test. The notion of “public interest”\nwas addressed\nby the High Court of Australia in *ICM Agriculture Pty Ltd v Commonwealth*\n(2009) 240 CLR 162 in which French CJ, Gummow and Crennan JJ said at\n[20]:\n\n\n\n> \n> “The term ‘in the public interest’ is one of broad import.\n> When used in a statute, the term classically imports\n> a discretionary value\n> judgment to be made by reference to undefined factual matters confined only by\n> the subject matter, scope and\n> purpose of the statute in question.”\n> \n\n\n1. Accordingly,\nin proceedings under the *Child Protection (Working with Children) Act\n2012*, the “public interest” must be considered in light of the\nparamount purpose of the Act, namely, to ensure the protection\nof children from\nsexual or physical harm: s 4 of the Act.\n2. When\napplying the public interest test, the Victorian Supreme Court has endorsed a\nbroad and not a narrow approach: *ZZ v Secretary Department of Justice*\n[[2013] VSC 267](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/vic/VSC/2013/267.html \"View Case\") (*ZZ*) per Bell J at [205]. While emphasising the main\npurpose of the Victorian legislation (equivalent to the NSW legislation) is the\nprotection of children from harm, the decision in *ZZ* at [202] also\nacknowledged the relevance and importance of rehabilitating offenders and their\nright to work. The private interests\nof an applicant such as their right to work\nin their chosen area of employment are also a factor to be taken into\nconsideration insofar\nas those private interests also have a broader community\nbenefit as per Bell J at [203]:\n\n\n\n> \n> “In the context of the right to work, the tribunal has (in my view,\n> correctly) taken into account the public interest in enabling\n> persons to engage\n> in their chosen field of employment or in the field in which they are most\n> suited to work, in not lightly turning\n> people away from their commitment to a\n> chosen career and in encouraging people to use their qualifications, experience\n> and expertise\n> for the benefit of others.” \n> \n\n\n1. The\nconcept of public interest has been determined by the Tribunal on the basis of\ngiving priority to the broad interests of the community\nover private interests:\n*Smith v Commissioner of Police* [[2014] NSWCATAD 184](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/184.html \"View Case\"); *CYY* at\n[75].\n2. If\nthe Tribunal is not satisfied that an applicant has met either of the first or\nsecond limbs in the two-part test, it is precluded\nfrom making an order enabling\nthe applicant to work with children.\n\n*No presumption that the\napplicant poses a risk to the safety of children*\n\n\n1. In\nundertaking this administrative review, there is no presumption that the\napplicant poses a risk to the safety of children. Neither\nparty bears the onus\nof proof. However, the applicant has a statutory obligation under s 27(4) of the\nAct to fully disclose to the\nTribunal any matters relevant to the\napplication.\n\n*The approach to fact finding and the assessment of\nrisk*\n\n\n1. In\nrecognition of the protective jurisdiction of the Act and the paramount\nconsideration being the safety, welfare and well-being\nof children, the Tribunal\nis bound to follow the decision in *BKE* at [33] when assessing\nrisk:\n\n\n\n> \n> “Thus in such cases it may be that NCAT can be satisfied that an\n> allegation of sexual abuse against an applicant is established.\n> Equally, NCAT\n> may be affirmatively satisfied that the relevant incident did not occur, in\n> which case it can be put aside. However,\n> in a context where the welfare of the\n> child is paramount and the question being posed concerns the risk of harm to\n> children, NCAT\n> may not be satisfied that an allegation of abuse has been made\n> out, but nevertheless conclude that the circumstances surrounding\n> a particular\n> incident or course of conduct means that there is a risk to a child or, more\n> correctly, that the existence of a risk\n> has not been disproven.”\n> \n\n\n1. The\napproach to fact finding as explained in *BKE* at [33] has been approved by\nthe Court of Appeal in *Tilley v Children’s Guardian*  [[2017] NSWCA\n174](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2017/174.html \"View Case\") (*Tilley*) at [34]-[45] and in *CXZ* per Simpson AJA at\n[57]:\n\n\n\n> \n> “The task of the Tribunal is, to expand on what Beech-Jones J said in\n> *BKE*, to determine, even if it is unable to be satisfied one way or the\n> other as to the truth of all or any of the allegations, whether,\n> by reason of\n> the *possibility* that the alleged conduct occurred, the applicant poses a\n> risk to the safety of children. [emphasis in original] If so, the Tribunal\n> must\n> refuse to grant a clearance. Of course, in that process the Tribunal will give\n> consideration to the strength of the evidence\n> supporting the allegations and\n> will, inevitably, reach conclusions about the truth or falsity of some. If it\n> finds any allegation\n> to be without foundation it will discard it from further\n> consideration. If it is satisfied that the allegation is well founded, it\n> will\n> assign to it such weight as it sees fit, in the consideration (inter alia) of\n> the circumstances listed in s 30. It is the allegations\n> between those two\n> extremes, those that are neither proved nor disproved, that the Tribunal must\n> address in determining whether the\n> applicant for a clearance poses a risk to\n> children.”\n> \n\n\n1. Thus,\nrelying upon the analysis in *CXZ* at [51], many cases will not lend\nthemselves to definitive factual determination. Where an allegation is neither\n“well founded”\nnor “groundless”, the Tribunal must\ndecide whether, on the evidence before it, the possibility that the conduct did\noccur\njustifies a finding that the applicant poses a risk to the safety of\nchildren: *CXZ* at [52]. The assessment and the weight to be assigned to\nallegations will depend upon the seriousness of the allegations, the strength\nof\nany evidentiary support for those allegations, and the relevance of the conduct\nthe subject of the allegations to the risk to\nthe safety of children if a\nclearance is granted to the applicant: *CXZ* at [53].\n2. The\nprotective jurisdiction of the Act was emphasised in *CXZ* per Simpson AJA\nat [58]:\n\n\n\n> \n> “It is plain that in some cases this will be the cause of potential\n> injustice to the applicant for a clearance. A person entirely\n> innocent of any\n> allegations may be refused a clearance because the evidence does not permit a\n> conclusion that the allegations are\n> without foundation and the inability to\n> reach such a conclusion leaves open sufficient possibility that the risk exists.\n> Analysis\n> of the relevant provisions of the Child Protection Act satisfies me\n> that the legislature preferred the risk of injustice to an applicant\n> to risk to\n> the safety of children.”\n> \n\n\n1. A\npositive finding by the Tribunal that alleged conduct has taken place will\ngenerally be determinative of an application: *Office of the Children’s\nGuardian v CFW* [[2016] NSWSC 1406](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2016/1406.html \"View Case\") (*CFW*) at [14]-[15], per Justice\nHarrison:\n\n\n\n> \n> “The first proposition is that, in assessing whether there is a risk to\n> the safety of children, the court or tribunal should\n> first consider whether (a)\n> positive findings can be made as to any alleged act(s) of wrongdoing on the\n> balance of probabilities,\n> or (b) whether the court or tribunal has “no\n> hesitation in rejecting the allegation as groundless”. A positive finding\n> on the balance of probabilitiesthat relevant conduct has taken place, if\n> such a finding can be made, will generally have a “decisive impact”\n> on the outcome\n> of the application.\n> The second proposition is that, even if no such “positive finding”\n> can be made, the court or tribunal is still obliged\n> to consider questions of\n> risk that may be indicated by all of the facts, unless it is determined that the\n> allegation is “groundless”.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n1. In\ndetermining the application, the Tribunal is required to consider “the\ntotality of the evidence”: *BKE* at [28] citing *The Commissioner\nfor Children and Young People v IK* [[2005] NSWSC 1136](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2005/1136.html \"View Case\") at [[83]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2005/1136.html#para83)- [[84]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2005/1136.html#para84). The\nTribunal is to make a decision based on the “cumulative effect” of\nthe matters before it: *CYY* at [69]-[71].\n2. The\nstandard to which the Tribunal must be satisfied before making a positive\nfinding in relation to an allegation is the civil standard,\nthat is on the\nbalance of probabilities, and not the criminal standard: *CFW* at\n[14]-[17], subject to the need to have regard to the principles in *Briginshaw\nv Briginshaw* [[1938] HCA 34](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/34.html \"View Case\"); [(1938) 60 CLR 336](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2060%20CLR%20336 \"View LawCiteRecord\") (*Briginshaw*). The *Briginshaw*\nprinciple can broadly be described as a standard of satisfaction to be reached\nwhere serious allegations are concerned. Put simply,\nserious allegations with\nserious consequences require more compelling evidence for the decision maker to\nreach the necessary state\nof reasonable satisfaction that the facts in dispute\nare more likely than not to exist.\n\n**The respondent’s\ncase**\n\n\n1. The\nkey allegations upon which the respondent placed weight were:\n\t* (1) those\n\tallegations that were the subject of the 2019 Criminal Trial;\n\t* (2) allegations\n\tin 2015 that the applicant hit Child 1 with her hands, belt and spoon, and\n\tpunished him excessively by requiring him\n\tto sit on stairs for prolonged periods\n\tof time;\n\t* (3) allegations\n\tthat the applicant punished Child 1 by withholding food; and\n\t* (4) allegations\n\tthat the applicant failed to protect Child 2 from sexual behaviour from Child\n\tC.\n2. The\nrespondent acknowledged that the applicant had a long history of caring for many\nchildren and as a Teacher’s Aide, and did\nnot cavil with the proposition\nthat there is public interest in the applicant being permitted to work in those\nroles for the broader\ncommunity benefit.\n3. The\nrespondent placed little weight on the expert’s opinion, arguing that:\n\t* (1) Dr Furst had\n\tassessed the applicant’s risk on the basis that she did not engage in any\n\tof the conduct alleged; and\n\t* (2) had Dr Furst\n\tconsidered the possibility that the applicant did engage in any of the conduct\n\talleged, his assessment of her clinical\n\trisk profile would have been different.\n4. In\nthe respondent’s submission, there is a high likelihood of repetition of\nthe same alleged behaviour because the applicant\nhas denied all allegations, has\nnot demonstrated a great deal of insight into whether her conduct may have\ninadvertently caused harm,\nand has not engaged with a counsellor to reflect upon\nthese matters and consider implementing strategies to ensure she does not engage\nin the same alleged conduct in the future.\n\n**The applicant’s\ncase**\n\n\n1. The\nvolume of allegations against the applicant is significant, as reflected in\ndocuments before the Tribunal. Although the respondent\nplaced weight on a\nsmaller number of allegations than those articulated in the Refusal Decision to\nargue its case in these proceedings,\nit was submitted on behalf of the applicant\nthat the allegations considered in the Refusal Decision framed the nature of the\nadministrative\nreview. That is not an unreasonable approach to take. The\nallegations identified in each of the nine government agency investigations\nwere\ntherefore addressed on behalf of the applicant and our reasons are structured\naccordingly.\n2. Arguing\nthat the Tribunal should find that the applicant does not pose a risk to the\nsafety of children, the key grounds relied upon\nwere:\n\t* (1) the\n\tapplicant’s consistent denial of the allegations;\n\t* (2) that Child\n\t1’s evidence suffered from credibility and reliability issues, taking into\n\taccount the following:\n\t\n\t> \n\t> (a) he had made allegations that were considered to be fabrication;\n\t> (b) his complaints were not made contemporaneously with the alleged conduct;\n\t> \n\t> \n\t> (c) some of the individuals named by him as witnessing the alleged conduct did\n\t> not give evidence in support;\n\t> \n\t> \n\t> (d) some of his allegations were put in exaggerated terms;\n\t> \n\t> \n\t>\n\t* (3) that the\n\tapplicant’s care history had been favourably reviewed by agency officials\n\tas required from time to time and, indeed,\n\tat the 5 year mark, there were no\n\tconcerns identified by Child C or any of the three siblings, all children\n\tappeared to be happy\n\tin the placement, and the applicant was assessed to be\n\tresourceful and to work well under pressure;\n\t* (4) Dr\n\tFurst’s opinion that the applicant had a low risk profile, having regard\n\tto the static, dynamic and protective factors\n\tidentified;\n\t* (5) that the\n\tsevere impact upon the applicant of the criminal proceedings in 2016 and 2019\n\tprovided strong grounds on which to conclude\n\tthat she would not, in the future,\n\tengage in conduct such as the conduct alleged or conduct the subject of the 2016\n\tassault charge;\n\tand\n\t* (6) character\n\treferences by third parties (discounted depending upon the knowledge of the\n\tvarious referees) supported the\n\tapplicant.\n\n**Consideration**\n\n\n*Mandatory considerations in s 30(1)(a)-(k) of the Act*\n\n\n1. In\ndetermining the application, we are obliged to consider the evidence under each\nof the headings in s 30(1)(a)-(k) of the Act. We\nfirst address those\nconsiderations in the context of the offences that gave rise to the 2019\nCriminal Trial and then examine further\nmatters we consider to be relevant in\ndetermining whether the applicant poses a risk to the safety of\nchildren.\n\n**The seriousness of the offences with respect to which\nthe person is a disqualified person or any matters that caused a refusal of\na\nclearance or imposition of an interim bar: s 30(1)(a)**\n\n\n1. The\noffences for which the applicant was charged and tried, but not convicted,\ninclude offences for physical and indecent assault,\nand are regarded as serious\noffences. The seriousness of the offences is heightened when considered in the\ncontext of the following\ndynamics:\n\t* (1) the level of\n\tcontrol that the applicant as the child’s full-time foster carer could\n\texercise over his welfare; and\n\t* (2) the level of\n\tvulnerability and dependency of the child who had suffered significant abuse and\n\ttrauma from his biological parents,\n\thad diagnosed disabilities, and was entirely\n\treliant upon the applicant for his physical, emotional and psychological needs\n\tfrom\n\tthe age of 3 until the age of 10, a period of around 7\n\tyears.\n2. The\napplicant denied each and every allegation and maintained her denials during\ncross-examination in the 2019 Criminal Trial (and\nin the proceedings before this\nTribunal).\n3. After\nweighing the evidence as a whole, His Honour could not conclude that the\nprosecution case had eliminated all reasonable doubt\nas to the guilt of the\ndefendant, and she was acquitted of all charges.\n4. The\nvarious other allegations with respect to Child T, Child 2 and Child 3 made\nagainst the applicant in her capacity as a foster\ncarer that did not result in\nany criminal proceedings against her are, likewise, considered to be serious. We\nsay this because of\nthe dynamics of control, vulnerability and dependency\noperating within the applicant’s relationships with foster children in\nher\ncare as set out above (noting that Child T’s history is not known, and\nChild 3 was not exposed to the same trauma and abuse\nthat Child 1 and Child 2\nsuffered).\n5. The\ncharge against the applicant of assaulting a woman in 2016 was a violent\noffence. It is considered to be less serious because\nthe victim was not a child,\nhowever it was not disputed that the assault occurred in an area where children\nwere present and could\nwitness the assault. Any child who witnessed the assault\nwould likely be at risk of suffering emotional and psychological harm. The\napplicant pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to a 9-month good\nbehaviour bond, without a conviction recorded.\n\n**The period of time\nsince those offences or matters occurred and the conduct of the person since\nthey occurred: s 30(1)(b)** \n\n\n1. The\ncharges entered for the purpose of the 2019 Criminal Trial were generally and\nvariously described as having occurred between 1\nJanuary 2013 and 31 December\n2015. In his interview with police on 21 February 2019, Child 1 generally\nestimated the year in which\nthe alleged conduct took place and his age at the\ntime. From that interview, the allegations generally appear to concern conduct\nthat occurred in 2013 and 2014. Accordingly, the period of time since the\nconduct was alleged to have occurred and the date when\nthis Tribunal heard the\napplication, is roughly between 9 and 10 years.\n2. In\nrelation to the other allegations the subject of investigations, we accept the\nsubmissions on behalf of the applicant that the\nperiod of time since the alleged\nconduct the subject of nine investigations is roughly:\n\t* (1) 16 to 18\n\tyears, with respect to the First Investigation (concerning allegations of\n\tphysical harm to Child C and Child T);\n\t* (2) 11 years,\n\twith respect to the Second Investigation (concerning allegations of excessive\n\tdisciplining of Child 1);\n\t* (3) 8 to 15\n\tyears, with respect to the Third Investigation (concerning allegations of\n\tsexualised behaviour of Child C towards Child\n\t1 and Child 2);\n\t* (4) 8 to 15\n\tyears, with respect to the Fourth Investigation (concerning allegations of\n\tinappropriate disciplining of Child 1);\n\t* (5) 6 years,\n\twith respect to the Fifth Investigation (concerning allegations of facilitated\n\tcontact of Child 1, Child 2 and Child\n\t3 with Child C) acknowledging that the\n\trespondent did not press or rely upon this allegation);\n\t* (6) 8 to 15\n\tyears, with respect to the Sixth Investigation (concerning allegations of\n\twithholding food as punishment of Child 1);\n\t* (7) 3 to 15\n\tyears, with respect to the Seventh Investigation (concerning allegations of\n\tsexual assault of Child 3);\n\t* (8) 8 to 15\n\tyears, with respect to the Eighth Investigation (concerning allegations the\n\tsubject of the 2019 Criminal Trial);\n\t* (9) 8 to 15\n\tyears, with respect to the Ninth Investigation (also concerning allegations the\n\tsubject of the 2019 Criminal Trial).\n3. The\nperiod of time since the applicant was charged (in 2016) with the offence of\ncommon assault of an adult, is around 7 years.\n4. There\nhas been no further conduct of concern by the applicant, noting that:\n\t* (1) Child T was\n\tnot in her care after November 2006;\n\t* (2) Child C was\n\tadopted by her and her husband on 13 May 2014;\n\t* (3) Child 1 was\n\trelinquished from her care on 13 June 2014;\n\t* (4) Child 2 was\n\tremoved from her care in November 2015;\n\t* (5) Child 3 was\n\tremoved from her care in March 2019.\n\n**The age of the\nperson at the time the offences or matters occurred: s 30(1)(c)**\n\n\n1. On\nthe basis that the conduct the subject of the 2019 Criminal Trial was alleged to\nhave occurred in 2013 and 2014, the applicant\nwas in her mid-forties, between 45\nand 47 years of age.\n2. Again,\naccepting submissions made on behalf of the applicant, her age at the time of\nthe alleged conduct the subject of nine investigations\nis estimated to have\nbeen:\n\t* (1) 36 to 39\n\tyears, with respect to the First Investigation;\n\t* (2) 43 or 44,\n\twith respect to the Second Investigation;\n\t* (3) 39 to 46\n\tyears, with respect to the Third Investigation;\n\t* (4) 39 to 46\n\tyears, with respect to the Fourth Investigation;\n\t* (5) 48 or 49,\n\twith respect to the Fifth Investigation (not pressed);\n\t* (6) 39 to 46\n\tyears, with respect to the Sixth Investigation;\n\t* (7) 39 to 51\n\tyears, with respect to the Seventh Investigation;\n\t* (8) 39 to 46\n\tyears, with respect to the Eighth Investigation;\n\t* (9) 39 to 46\n\tyears, with respect to the Ninth Investigation.\n3. The\napplicant was around 49 years old at the time she committed the offence of\ncommon assault of an adult in 2016.\n\n**The age of each victim of any\nrelevant offence or conduct at the time they occurred and any matters relating\nto the vulnerability\nof the victim: s 30(1)(d)**\n\n\n1. Child\n1 was in the care of the applicant between February 2007 and June 2014 when he\nwas between 3 and 10 years old. Based on his\ninterview with police, the conduct\nthe subject of the 2019 Criminal Trial was alleged to have taken place in 2013\nand 2014 when Child\n1 was somewhere between 9 and 11 years of age. Child 2 was\nthe twin of Child 1, and Child 3 was their sibling, 3 years younger.\n2. Child\n1 lived with the applicant in her home and was fully dependent upon her for his\nphysical, emotional, psychological and developmental\nneeds. He was particularly\nvulnerable due to his intellectual disability, young age, status as a child in\nfoster care, previous traumatic\nhistory of neglect caused by his birth parents\nand previous sexual abuse resulting in his immature bowel control as a very\nyoung\nchild and his observed age-inappropriate sexualised behaviours.\n3. Child\n2, likewise, was objectively vulnerable because of her exposure to sexual abuse\nand neglect by her biological parents, her young\nage, her status as a child in\nfoster care and being fully reliant upon the applicant for her welfare and care,\nand her observed emotional\nfragility and distress when interviewed.\n4. Child\n3 had not been exposed to the abuse and neglect that his siblings had suffered.\nHowever, he was vulnerable by virtue of his\nstatus as a child in foster care and\nhis various medical diagnoses.\n\n**The difference in age between the\nvictim and the person and the relationship (if any) between the victim and the\nperson: s 30(e)**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant is 36 years older than Child 1, and was his foster carer for around 7\nyears. The applicant’s relationship with\nthis child appears to have been\ncomplex and difficult, given that she relinquished his care due to concerns she\nheld about his sexualised\nbehaviour. The applicant’s evidence in\ncross-examination was that his behaviour was difficult to deal with and she\nstruggled\nwith his soiling problem. When asked to describe her emotional\nrelationship with Child 1, she said she had to be quite guarded because\nof the\nfear that when she showed affection to either Child 1 or Child 2, it could be\nmisunderstood by them to be a sexual advance.\nAs a result, her evidence was that\nshe and her husband were “never affectionate with the twins”\ncompared with the other\nchildren in the household. She acknowledged that she got\nfrustrated and “lost it” with Child 1. However, she said that\ndid\nnot stop her from loving him. She also said she did not punish Child 1 any more\nthan any other child. She acknowledged that she\nhad described Child 1 as being a\nliar and predator (in the sense that he frequently sought to engage in sexual\nbehaviour with strangers),\nand did not resile from that position. The\napplicant’s relationship with Child 1 is examined in greater depth in\nthese reasons\nwhen assessing her overall risk to the safety of children.\n2. The\napplicant is also 36 years older than Child 2 and was her foster carer for a\nslightly longer period of time, around 8 years and\n9 months. The applicant\nappears to have had a stronger relationship with this child although she has\ndescribed the child as a liar\nand a bully. The child herself described the\nrelationship with the applicant as being “pretty good”.\n3. The\napplicant is 39 years older than Child 3 and was his foster carer since he was\nonly 2 days old and stayed in her care for around\n11 years and 8 months. The\napplicant appears to have built a strong bond with this child who is now almost\n16 years of age, and would\nlike to have him restored to her\ncare.\n\n**Whether the person knew, or could reasonably have known,\nthat the victim was a child: s 30(f)**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant knew the victim was a child, being his foster carer (and indeed the\nfoster carer of his siblings and Child T) at the\nrelevant time(s) when\nallegations were made against her.\n\n**The person’s present\nage: s 30(1)(g)**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant is currently 55 years of age.\n\n**The seriousness of the\nperson’s criminal history and the conduct of the person since the matters\noccurred: s 30(1)(h)**\n\n\n1. The\nseriousness of the applicant’s criminal history was discussed above in\nrelation to ss 30(1)(a) and 30(1)(b) of the Act.\n2. There\nhave been no further criminal charges laid against the\napplicant.\n\n**The likelihood of any repetition by the person of the\noffences or conduct and the impact on children of any such repetition: s\n30(1)(i)**\n\n\n1. It\nis clear from the applicant’s submission dated 7 April 2021 to the\nChildren’s Guardian that she has suffered emotional\nand psychological\ndistress from the events associated with the 2019 Criminal Trial and the\ncriminal proceedings associated with her\nassault of an adult in 2016. She has\nstruggled to cope with the removal of Child 3, whom she refers to as “her\nson”.\nShe had several psychologist appointments to help her manage her\nmental health associated with that loss. She described losing her\nson, her job,\nher self-respect and her self-confidence, and said that her family was\ndestroyed. We accept that the applicant’s\ndistress over these matters will\nbe protective factors against future inappropriate conduct.\n2. However,\nin describing what she had learned from her experiences and her engagement with\na psychologist, her submission to the Children’s\nGuardian contained the\nfollowing statement:\n\n\n\n> \n> “Just because someone says bad things about you it does not make them\n> true. I also learnt that you should NEVER allow yourself\n> to take on board\n> someone else’s issues, they are simply that, someone else’s\n> ...”\n> \n\n\n1. In\nour view, her submission is defensive and suggests she had not fully reflected\nupon the circumstances surrounding the allegations\nmade by Child 1. Her\nsubmission sought to deflect blame and did not hold herself accountable.\n2. Dr\nFurst explained that the tools used to predict the risk of future violence were\nprimarily concerned with violent offending. He\nmaintained that the risk\nprediction tools he had applied were a useful guide but conceded that they are\nfar from precise in terms\nof accurately predicting human behaviour, especially\nat the individual level.\n3. He\nagreed that children can be harmed by behaviour that falls below the level of\ncriminal violence, and acknowledged there are not\nmany tools specifically\ntargeted at lower levels of behaviour such as harsh parenting. He readily\nconceded that his expertise was\nnot in the area of parenting styles.\n4. When\nasked whether the applicant’s assault of an adult demonstrated emotional\ndysregulation over a relatively minor inconvenience,\nDr Furst’s confident\nopinion was that the applicant did not meet the threshold for emotional\ndysregulation. In his opinion,\nthe reason for the applicant assaulting the\nvictim was not relevant. In his view, what really matters is a pattern of\noffending (as\nin the number of offences) and the age of onset for such\noffending.\n5. Under\ncross-examination, he acknowledged that if he had proceeded on the basis that\nthe allegations against the applicant were true,\nher clinical risk profile would\nbe different.\n6. We\naccept Dr Furst’s opinion on the static, dynamic and protective factors\nidentified as being relevant to assessing the applicant’s\nrisk. However,\nnoting his explanation of the limitations of the tools applied to predict human\nbehaviour, his acknowledgment that\nhis expertise is in violent crime and not\nparenting behaviour, and that his opinion was based on an assumption that the\nallegations\nagainst the application were not true, his opinion does not greatly\nassist in our evaluation of the applicant’s risk to the\nsafety of\nchildren.\n7. The\napplicant has recently undertaken two online parenting courses over four hours\nand received certificates for completing “Advanced\nParenting Skills”\nand “Positive Parenting Program” courses. Topics covered in the\ncourses included dealing with\nanxieties and emotions, discipline strategies,\nage-appropriate exclusions, children’s mental health issues, behavioural\nissues\nand reinforcing positive behaviours. She said she believed she had\ndeveloped and refined skills in areas of discipline. The applicant\nidentified\nsteps that she would take in the future including that she would not hit\nchildren or make them sit on stairs for long\nperiods of time as a punishment.\nHowever, under cross-examination, she did not indicate a great deal of insight\nas to how to apply\nthe knowledge acquired in the courses when dealing with\ndifficult behaviours in children.\n8. Dr\nFurst’s report noted that the applicant was continuing to consult with a\nclinical psychologist on a regular basis, but no\nfurther information was\nprovided to us. Absent any information that the applicant has engaged in\ncounselling to reflect upon the\ncontribution that her conduct (whether\nintentional or inadvertent) may have had on the relationship dynamics or the\ncontext in which\nvarious allegations were made against her, we find it likely\nthat she will not engage in mitigation strategies to ensure the conduct\nis not\nrepeated.\n\n**Any order of a court or tribunal that is in force in\nrelation to the person: s 30(1)(i1)**\n\n\n1. The\nTribunal understands there are no other orders of a court or tribunal in force\nin relation to the applicant to be taken into consideration.\n\n**Any\ninformation given by the applicant in, or in relation to, the application: s\n30(1)(j)**\n\n\n1. In\nsupport of her application the applicant’s submission to the\nChildren’s Guardian on 7 April 2021 argued that:\n\t* (1) the\n\tallegations made by Child 1 were made in spite, and were completely untrue;\n\t* (2) the Wesley\n\tDalmar Caseworker had told her that Child 1 had to stop making allegations\n\tagainst her and this was revealed in the\n\ttrial;\n\t* (3) she had been\n\tcleared of all charges in the criminal trial;\n\t* (4) Child 1 had\n\tmade false allegations against other people;\n\t* (5) no\n\tallegations had been made against her by any other children in her\n\tcare.\n2. In\nresponse to a question about what the applicant thought was important in keeping\nchildren safe, she stated:\n\t* (1) supporting\n\tchildren, allowing them to achieve the best in their lives;\n\t* (2) always being\n\tthere for them;\n\t* (3) allowing\n\tchildren to learn and encourage them to be who they are;\n\t* (4) loving them\n\tunconditionally.\n3. She\nprovided eleven character references in support from friends, neighbours, a\nformer student, the parents of students where the\napplicant worked, a colleague\nand an executive officer of FACS which attested to her:\n\t* (1) strong bond\n\twith Child 3 and her grief in his removal from her care (referee Ms R, referee\n\tMs F);\n\t* (2) composure\n\tand calm nature despite dealing with difficult circumstances (referee Ms\n\tF);\n\t* (3) honesty,\n\tcaring nature and support to others when dealing with tragic circumstances, her\n\thard work in taking care of her own family,\n\tbuilding confidence in her boys with\n\tschool, work and sporting interests, and that she instilled in her boys values\n\tto be courteous,\n\tpolite, helpful and friendly (referee Mr S);\n\t* (4) kindness,\n\tfamily orientation, and a person who always put her family first and noted that\n\tthe children in her care adored her\n\t(referee Mr M);\n\t* (5) caring and\n\tnurturing relationships with both her own children and those in her foster care,\n\tnoting that she had looked after the\n\treferee’s own children on various\n\toccasions and they enjoyed being with the applicant (referee Ms LF);\n\t* (6) ability to\n\tmake a student feel safe (referee Ms E);\n\t* (7) ability to\n\thelp students and provide good advice for their future (referee Mr S);\n\t* (8) warmth,\n\tcompassion, gentle and caring nature, and her commitment to school events,\n\tfundraisers and working bees (referee Ms M);\n\t* (9) ability to\n\thelp students with special needs and their families, and a person with a\n\t“beautiful soul” (referee Ms B);\n\t* (10) professional\n\tand caring manner when dealing with the educational and welfare needs of\n\tstudents, and the referee stated that she\n\tsupported the applicant in engaging in\n\tunsupervised child-related work (referee Ms J); and\n\t* (11) provision\n\tof love, attention and expert care to foster children over around 20 years, and\n\tthe referee said the applicant has\n\tthe character, skill and abilities to manage\n\tchildren effectively in a home or school environment (referee Mr\n\tB).\n4. We\nalso note the comments made by the principal of a school where the applicant had\nbeen a staff member and Child 3 a student. The\nprincipal described the applicant\nin a positive manner and expressed her belief that the applicant was not capable\nof harming Child\n3.\n5. On\nbalance, on the basis that the referees’ statements do not disclose that\nthey are aware of the facts before the Tribunal,\nwe have given their statements\nonly a small amount of weight.\n\n**Any relevant information in\nrelation to the person that was obtained in accordance with section 36A: s\n30(1)(j1)**\n\n\n1. The\nTribunal understands there is no other relevant information in relation to the\napplicant obtained in accordance with s 36A of\nthe Act (exchange of information\nto bodies in other jurisdictions) to be taken into\nconsideration.\n\n**Any other matters that the Children’s\nGuardian considers necessary: s 30(1)(k)**\n\n\n1. The\nRefusal Decision set out the matters that the Children’s Guardian\nconsiders necessary, as discussed earlier in these reasons.\n2. Written\nand oral submissions on behalf of the Children’s Guardian also addressed\nthose matters which the Children’s Guardian\nconsiders necessary.\n3. It\nwas submitted that the primary position of the Children’s Guardian is\nbased on risk, and the need to be particularly careful\nabout the characteristics\nof a person who works with vulnerable children as a carer and works with\nchildren with learning difficulties\nand special educational needs.\n4. In\nthe Children’s Guardian’s assessment, the overall picture that\nemerged from the allegations showed a concerning pattern\nof repeated physical\nand psychological harm to very vulnerable children with a traumatic history. It\nwas submitted that, consistent\nwith the observations of caseworkers over time,\nthe applicant showed a pattern of targeting and scapegoating Child 1 and Child\n2,\nand characterising them as perpetrators, bullies and liars. This, it was\nsubmitted, resulted in the applicant not taking disclosures\nby the children\nseriously.\n5. Whilst\nit was not suggested that the applicant deliberately set out to cause harm, the\nChildren’s Guardian considered that the\napplicant showed no insight into\nwhether her behaviour had inadvertently caused issues for children with a\ntraumatic history and\nhad not sought counselling to assist her to reflect upon\nthat possibility.\n6. The\nChildren’s Guardian submitted that a reasonable person, made aware of all\nthe matters before the Tribunal, would not allow\ntheir child to have\nunsupervised contact with the applicant.\n\n*Tribunal’s\napproach to weighing the available evidence to make findings and assess the\napplicant’s risk*\n\n\n1. In\ndeciding the application, the protective jurisdiction of the legislation towards\nchildren must prevail, even if the consequences\nare that a person who is\ninnocent of allegations is denied a clearance because the evidence leaves open\nsufficient possibility that\nhe or she is a risk: *CXZ* per Simpson AJA at\n[58].\n2. Applying\nthe criminal standard, His Honour dismissed the charges in the 2019 Criminal\nTrial. However, when assessing whether a person\nposes a risk to the safety of\nchildren, this Tribunal examines allegations at the lower threshold, on the\nbalance of probabilities,\nsubject to having regard to the *Briginshaw*\nprinciple.\n3. Moreover,\nin evaluating the evidence before us, it is not necessary for this Tribunal to\nfind that the offences or the alleged conduct\noccurred. It is sufficient to\nconclude that it is *possible* that the alleged conduct occurred before\nthen proceeding to consider whether, based on the allegations, the applicant\nposes a risk\nto the safety of children.\n4. We\nagree with the oral submissions made on behalf of the Children’s Guardian\nthat this is not a straightforward case, but one\ninvolving a very delicate\nbalancing act. The competing requirements to be balanced concern, on one hand,\nthe consequences of allowing\nthe applicant to work with children who may suffer\nharm (and those consequences may be severe) and, on the other hand, the\nconsequences\nof finding she is a risk to the safety of children and denying her\nthe opportunity to undertake work that provides a community benefit.\n5. The\nvolume of documentary evidence before us is substantial. Unfortunately, the\nmaterial relating to various government agency investigations\ninto allegations\nagainst the applicant in her capacity as a carer is not comprehensive. In\nrelation to some investigations, we only\nhave a reported outcome of the\ninvestigation and do not have the complete record of what had been considered.\nThat posed a difficulty\nfor this Tribunal in weighing up the evidence in order\nto make findings.\n6. In\nweighing the evidence, assessing the credibility and reliability of statements\nmade by each of the three siblings is not without\ncomplication. We have taken\ninto account the medical opinions regarding Child 1 and Child 3, and the\nassessed vulnerabilities of\neach of the three siblings. The dynamics in this\nfamily were peculiarly complex, with varying degrees of resentment among the\nthree\nsiblings towards each other.\n7. When\nassessing the credibility and reliability of Child 1’s evidence, there is\nno expert opinion before this Tribunal on which\nwe can rely, to consider whether\nrepressed memories of the abuse and neglect suffered by him at the hands of his\nbirth parents may\nhave been confused with memories of his time in care with the\napplicant. There is no objective material on which we can rely to assess\nwhether\nhis intellectual disability or medical diagnoses may have contributed to any\nconfabulation or exaggeration of events.\n8. In\nher statement dated 11 April 2019, the Wesley Dalmar Caseworker noted his\nintellectual disability and queried the accuracy of his\nmemory:\n\n\n\n> \n> “[Child 1] has been diagnosed with an intellectual disability and in my\n> conversations it has been difficult to establish context\n> and further detail from\n> [Child 1] about what he has experienced. This causes me to question the accuracy\n> of his memory when I consider\n> his trauma background in terms of where events\n> occurred and who was involved.” \n> \n\n\n1. The\nCaseworker’s statement does not purport to express an expert opinion (nor\nis it taken in that vein) that the child’s\ndisclosures suffer from\ninherent unreliability due to his intellectual disability and trauma history.\nNonetheless, as previously\nnoted, there are a number of aspects to the\nchild’s evidence that reduce the credibility and reliability of his\ndisclosures.\n2. It\nis reasonable to regard the child’s disclosures with caution when we also\ntake into account a number of factors including\nthat his allegations were not\nmade contemporaneously and were largely not corroborated. The accuracy of his\nmemory of events may\nhave suffered with the lapse of time between leaving the\napplicant’s care and being placed with his new Wesley Dalmar foster\ncarer.\nSome of his disclosures were expressed in the plural (referring to\n“they”) and some were exaggerated accounts.\nHe may have blurred the\nlines between fact and fiction, as evidenced by his reference to scenes in\nmovies to describe his own alleged\nexperience. He had previously made false\nallegations of a serious nature about sexual activity involving other people,\nand those\nallegations were found to be a fabrication.\n3. We\nhave structured our reasons to make findings in three areas:\n\t* (1) the charges\n\tthat gave rise to the 2019 Criminal Trial;\n\t* (2) the offence\n\tof common assault of an adult in 2016;\n\t* (3) the nine\n\tgovernment agency investigations.\n\n*The 2019 Criminal\nTrial*\n\n\n**The indecent assault allegation**\n\n\n1. The\ncomplainant maintained his allegation that he was made to touch the\napplicant’s vagina whilst he was bathing in an upstairs\nbathroom. However,\nparts of his testimony during cross-examination were inconsistent with his\nevidence-in-chief. When asked about\nthe alleged incident, he asserted that\nbefore the applicant made him touch her, she asked him which private part he\nwished to touch,\nand he said “none of them”. This new detail was not\nmentioned at all in his recorded interview. Indeed, when asked during\nthe\ninterview whether the applicant had said anything to him, he answered\n“no”. Although found to have good concentration\nand to be a credible\nwitness, the reliability of his evidence beyond reasonable doubt suffered as a\nresult of his additional assertion\nduring the trial.\n2. His\nHonour noted the “horrendous abuse” suffered by the complainant as a\nvery young child and commented that memories\nof such severe abuse would be\nexpected to remain in his mind and have on-going effects. His Honour further\ncommented that the child’s\nlast minute addition of such an important\ndetail as a request by the applicant that he nominate which private part he\nwished to touch\n“prompts concern about the overall reliability of his\naccount and whether he might be confused about other events earlier in\nhis life\ninvolving other people”.\n3. We\nhave before us an allegation by the complainant about a serious offence and a\nclear denial by the applicant that the conduct occurred.\nIn seeking to be\nsatisfied one way or another on the balance of probabilities as to the truth of\nthe allegation, we have taken into\naccount a number of matters, namely:\n\t* (1) the\n\tapplicant’s denial of the alleged conduct;\n\t* (2) the\n\tapplicant’s evidence that, in the year that the child was placed in her\n\tcare, he stopped having baths because of his\n\tsoiling problem;\n\t* (3) Child 1\n\tasserted that he had been in the bath in the upstairs bathroom with his twin\n\tsibling before the alleged incident but that\n\tshe had finished bathing and had\n\tleft the room so that he was then alone in the bath. However, there were no\n\tcorroborating accounts\n\tfrom Child 2 or Child 3 that they and Child 1 bathed\n\tupstairs at that time in their lives. Indeed, in a recorded interview on 19\n\tMarch 2019, Child 2 gave a clear explanation about the bathrooms in the\n\thousehold and how they were used. She said that they had\n\tbaths when they were\n\tyoung, but mostly had showers when older because it was quicker. She said she\n\tdid not have baths with her brothers.\n\tThe further available evidence is that the\n\tchildren mostly had showers downstairs since the applicant had difficulty going\n\tup stairs\n\tbecause of a knee problem, and baths were avoided because of Child\n\t1’s soiling problem;\n\t* (4) the\n\tapplicant’s evidence that she had had surgery on both knees and had\n\tdifficulty climbing the 18 stairs in her house to\n\treach the upstairs bathroom,\n\teven though she had not mentioned that in her police interview;\n\t* (5) concern\n\tabout the overall reliability of Child 1’s account given inconsistencies\n\tin his evidence;\n\t* (6) that there\n\tis no corroborating evidence that the alleged conduct took place;\n\t* (7) that there\n\twas no contemporaneous complaint or disclosure made by Child 1 although we\n\taccept that a child may be reticent to complain\n\tabout a carer whilst still in a\n\tplacement. However, it was open to him to tell his teachers with whom, as noted\n\tin paragraph 116\n\tof the Judgment, he had regular and sympathetic contact;\n\t* (8) the\n\tchild’s disclosure about such a significant matter was not made until the\n\tthird occasion on which he was interviewed;\n\t* (9) the\n\tchild’s intellectual disability and traumatic history of being sexually\n\tabused by his biological parents;\n\t* (10) the\n\tchild’s history of making allegations against other people of\n\tinappropriate sexual conduct that were found to be false;\n\t* (11) there is no\n\tevidence of the applicant having sexual interest in children or engaging in\n\tsexual misbehaviour towards children,\n\tand no evidence of her having any sexual\n\tinterest in Child 1;\n\t* (12) the\n\tapplicant’s relationship with Child 1 was not emotionally close (as\n\tobserved by teachers) such as to provide a context\n\tfor potential sexual\n\tapproaches and, indeed, the applicant’s own evidence was strongly that she\n\twas very guarded about showing\n\taffection to Child 1 because of his sexual\n\thistory.\n4. Drawing\nfrom the Judgment, we agree with His Honour’s assessment at paragraph\n104:\n\n\n\n> \n> “The touching described by [Child 1] clearly connotes sexual interest in\n> him by [the applicant] and, if it occurred, would\n> most likely have been\n> instigated by her for the purpose of sexual gratification Sexual interest of\n> that kind is inconsistent and\n> difficult to reconcile with the other allegations\n> of sadistic, physical abuse which strongly imply dislike if not outright\n> hostility\n> by [the applicant] towards [Child 1] who at the time was still a\n> prepubescent boy. There is no other evidence of sexual interest\n> in children or\n> sexual misbehaviour towards them by [the applicant].”\n> \n\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. On\nthe totality of the evidence before us, we are satisfied that the allegation of\nindecent assault has no foundation. Accordingly,\nwe have discarded the\nallegation in our assessment of the applicant’s risk towards the safety of\nchildren.\n\n**The Glen20 Allegation** \n\n\n1. We\nhave before us an allegation by the complainant about a serious offence and a\nclear denial by the applicant that the conduct occurred,\nand no other evidence\nto corroborate the allegation.\n2. Child\n1 alleged that after he showered in the downstairs bathroom, he was still\nstanding in the shower when the applicant took the\nGlen20 from under the sink,\napproached him in the shower, forced his mouth open with her finger and sprayed\nGlen20 into his mouth\nfor around 10 seconds. He alleged that, before spraying\nthe Glen20 into his mouth, the applicant told him to not spit it out, and\nthen\nshe told him to take the garbage out. He said that he spat the Glen20 out when\nhe was outside so that the applicant couldn’t\nsee because he thought she\nwould have hit him if she knew he had ignored her direction.\n3. If\nthe allegation was truthful, it was a sadistic and cruel act by the applicant.\nIt is also an act that a person on the receiving\nend would never forget and an\nact that would cause physical and sustained psychological harm to a child.\n4. At\nthe time of his recorded interview, Child 1 was aged 15 years and 6 months. His\nanswers to questions were unsophisticated. He had\nno hesitation in describing\nthe alleged assault although he provided unnecessary details at times and that\nadditional commentary\nsuggested that he was easily distracted\n5. His\naccount of the Glen20 allegation was, at times, disjointed. He could not\ndescribe in detail the pyjamas that he said he changed\ninto, although he added\ndetail about turning off taps. He could not remember why Glen20 was sprayed into\nhis mouth. He initially\nsaid that the applicant said nothing to him, but then\nsaid that she had told him to open his mouth, swallow the Glen20, not spit\nit\nout, and to then go to get the garbage. He described the doors to the shower as\nbeing sliding doors, but then said they were a\n“glass pull and push\ndoor”. He gave the appearance of having a good memory about some details,\nbut not others.\n6. The\napplicant’s unequivocal evidence in the trial was that the cannister of\nGlen20 was always kept on the bathroom window sill,\nand never in a cupboard. She\nalso rejected the assertion that Child 1 had taken out the garbage. Her evidence\nwas that whilst he\nmay have taken out the bin twice in the time he lived with\nthe applicant, it was not his job to take the rubbish out.\n7. The\nchild’s initial disclosure to the Wesley Dalmar Caseworker was that\n“they used to spray Glen20 my mouth”. Under\ncross-examination he\ncorrected that detail and said that it was the applicant, and that it had only\nhappened once. He also denied\nhaving said what the Caseworker recorded as the\nwords he had used. We do not regard the child’s correction or denial as an\ninconsistency such that it contradicts his essential claim about what he alleged\ntook place. However, it detracts from both the credibility\nand reliability of\nhis disclosure.\n8. Whilst\na period of 10 seconds may ordinarily be regarded as a very short amount of\ntime, a person who is on the receiving end of having\na toxic chemical sprayed\ndirectly into their mouth for a sustained period of 10 seconds would, we\nsuggest, find that period of time\nto be so long as to be unbearable. The\nestimate of 10 seconds may simply have been given without careful thought, or\nhad been exaggerated.\nThe complainant said that he felt he was going to vomit,\nyet he managed to hold the chemical in his mouth until he was outside, taking\nout the garbage. We do not find this account to be plausible.\n9. There\nis no evidence of the allegation other than the child’s account. There is\nno contemporaneous disclosure of the allegation\nto his siblings in the household\nor to his teachers who supported him or\ncaseworkers.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. In\nweighing up the evidence before us, we are not satisfied on the balance of\nprobabilities that the conduct, as alleged, took place.\nOn the material before\nus, it is not safe to conclude that there was a possibility that the alleged\nconduct occurred. Accordingly,\nin our assessment of risk, we do not place any\nweight on the allegation.\n\n**The Kitchen Plate Allegation**\n\n\n1. Again,\nthere is an allegation by Child 1 about serious, violent conduct towards him by\nthe applicant, and a clear denial by her.\n2. Child\n1 alleged that, in the same year as the Glen20 allegation, the applicant broke a\nplate over his head. He recalled that the applicant’s\nhusband, her two\nbiological sons and one of those son’s girlfriends, Child C and his two\nsiblings (Child 2 and Child 3) were\nall in the house, although not all in the\nsame room. His recollection was that the applicant’s husband, Child C and\nhis two\nsiblings were present at the dinner table. After he finished dinner, he\nput his plate in the sink, describing the plate as being\nmade of hard plastic,\nwhite, with flowers and a blue ring around the top. He said the applicant took\nthe plate from the sink, smashed\nit over his head for no reason and then said\n“Look what you made me do” which he said reminded him of the song of\nthe\nsame name by Taylor Swift. He said that pieces of the plate were smashed\neverywhere and the applicant used a dust pan and small broom\nto clean them up.\nHe said he felt pain on his head and then wet himself. He asserted that everyone\nin the room saw what happened.\n3. Again,\nhis account is interspersed with statements that reflect an unsophisticated\ndemeanour.\n4. The\napplicant denied hitting Child 1 over the head with a plate although she\nrecalled an incident when he had jumped up from the table,\nknocking a plate of\nfood out of her hand and onto the table where it smashed. The applicant believed\nthe plate would have been part\nof a white Corelle dinner set with blue\nflowers.\n5. Neither\nChild 2 nor Child 1, when interviewed, recalled an incident involving such\nviolence.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. On\nthe evidence before us, we are not satisfied on the balance of probabilities\nthat the conduct, as alleged, took place. It is not\nsafe to conclude that there\nwas a possibility that the alleged conduct occurred. Accordingly, in our\nassessment of risk, we do not\nplace any weight on the allegation or on the fact\nthat the allegation was made.\n\n**The Belt Allegation**\n\n\n1. Child\n1 alleged that he had been in bed when the applicant called him to her bedroom,\npulled his pants down and slapped him on his\nbare bottom with her\nhusband’s belt, for no reason. In his interview with police, he described\nthe belt as black leather with\na silver or chrome buckle, and the one the\napplicant’s husband wore for work. His account was that once he arrived at\nthe doorway\nto the applicant’s bedroom, she took his arm and dragged him\ninto the room, laid him on her bed so that his legs were hanging\noff the bed,\npulled his pyjama pants and pull-up nappy down, grabbed the belt and then hit\nhim twice to his bare bottom. He described\nwhat he felt as hard leather that\nmade a mark because it stung for around 10 or 15 seconds and then the pain went\naway. His recollection\nwas that the husband was at work at the time and that the\nother children were upstairs in their bedrooms. He said that he did not\nknow why\nhe was hit with the belt, and that afterwards he went up to bed to sleep. He\nsaid that he didn’t tell anyone about\nwhat had occurred.\n2. The\napplicant participated in an interview with police on 18 March 2019 and a\ntranscript of that interview was admitted in the 2019\nCriminal Trial.\n3. The\napplicant denied that she used a belt to hit Child 1. Her evidence in the trial\nwas that her husband didn’t like belts and\nhe only owned one brown belt\nwhich he had to wear with this work pants to hold them up.\n4. When\nit was put to him in cross-examination that the applicant’s husband never\nhad a black belt and that he had a brown belt,\nthe complainant said “he\nprobably got rid of the black one.” The Child’s evidence was that\nthe applicant’s\nhusband was at work when he alleged he was hit. If that\nwas the case, on the evidence of the applicant, the belt was not at her disposal\nat that time since her husband always wore it to work.\n5. Apart\nfrom a number of inconsistent statements made by Child 3 about whether the\napplicant used her hands or a belt to hit Child 1\n(examined in relation to the\nFourth Investigation), there is no evidence to corroborate the\nallegation.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. On\nthe evidence before us, we are not satisfied on the balance of probabilities\nthat the conduct, as alleged, took place. It is not\nsafe to conclude that there\nwas a possibility that the alleged conduct occurred. Accordingly, in our\nassessment of risk, we do not\nplace any weight on the\nallegation.\n\n**The Toilet Flushing Allegation**\n\n\n1. Child\n1 described the allegation. He had been playing outside with toys when the\napplicant called him inside and asked whether he\nhad done anything naughty, to\nwhich he replied that he had not. The applicant then pushed him with the palm of\nher hand to the bathroom\nand followed him into the bathroom. While the child was\nstanding, the applicant pushed his head so that it was inside the toilet\nwith\nhis neck touching the rim of the toilet bowl and then flushed the toilet for 30\nseconds, drenching his head and hair with water.\nAfter the water stopped\nflushing, he told the applicant to stop and she moved her hand away.\n2. When\nasked how many times this had happened to him, he said “many other\ntimes” and then estimated that it had happened\nfour times.\n3. We\nnote that the child’s answers to questions in his recorded interview were\nunsophisticated and were naively literal in the\nsense of how he described\nthings. For instance, when asked what he was feeling when having his head\nflushed in the toilet, he answered\n“cold”, but did not describe his\nemotional response to the alleged act. He made reference to the\n“chipmunks”\nmovie in the sense that chipmunks had their head pushed\nin a toilet and also a movie called “Meet the Fockers” as depicting\na dog and cat flushing a toilet. He became distracted in relaying events in the\nmovie before being brought back to the questions\nbeing asked.\n4. The\napplicant denied the allegation, saying in the criminal trial “That\ndidn’t happen by me, no”.\n5. The\napplicant said Child 2 didn’t like her twin brother and was aggressive\ntowards him. She said that Child 2 and her friends\nhad flushed Child 1’s\nhead in the toilet at school a few times, although she was unable to clarify how\nmany times it happened.\n6. The\nevidence of Child 1 having his head flushed in the toilet at school and whether\nit was investigated by the school at the time\nis insufficient to conclude either\nway.\n7. On\nthe evidence before us, it is difficult to assess whether the child’s\naccount has blurred fact and fiction, in light of his\nreferences to movie\nscenes. It is also possible that the child has confused events over time about\nhaving his head flushed in toilets,\nincluding at\nschool.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. On\nbalance, we are not satisfied that the conduct occurred, as alleged. On the\nevidence, it is not safe to conclude that there was\na possibility that the\nalleged conduct occurred. Accordingly, in our assessment of risk, we do not\nplace any weight on the allegation.\n\n**The Shower Toothbrush\nAllegation**\n\n\n1. Child\n1 alleged that the applicant used the bristles on his toothbrush to retrieve\nfaeces from his bottom whilst he was in the shower\nin the downstairs bathroom\nand brush his teeth with it. He asserted that this occurred in the same bathroom\nas the Glen20 Allegation\nand that the applicant had entered the bathroom and\ntaken the child’s toothbrush from the toothbrush holder on the sink, told\nhim to turn around and bend down. She then retrieved faeces from the area around\nhis anus with the toothbrush, put the toothbrush\nin his mouth and brushed his\nteeth with it, saying nothing. He asserted that he told her to stop and yanked\nthe toothbrush out of\nhis mouth, she then washed the toothbrush under the tap\nand he rinsed his mouth out with water from the shower. He described feeling\nsick at the taste of the faeces and subsequently rinsed his toothbrush really\nwell. He said there was no one else in the bathroom\nat the time and he did not\ntell anyone about the incident until after he left the placement.\n2. The\napplicant denied the allegation and denied that she punished the child for\nsoiling himself.\n3. In\nweighing up the evidence, we have carefully considered the child’s\ndescription of the incident during his recorded interview.\nHis account was\ndetailed and appeared to not be embellished or exaggerated, saying the amount of\nfaeces on the toothbrush was a “little\nbit”. His evidence during the\ntrial was consistent with his recorded interview. Despite being challenged under\ncross-examination\non precisely when and to whom he disclosed the allegation, the\nchild maintained that the incident did actually happen with the applicant.\n4. In\na statement dated 31 July 2019, a class teacher recorded that:\n\t* (1) Child 1\n\toften soiled himself and was fearful to tell anyone that he had had an\n\taccident;\n\t* (2) she had\n\tfound three or four bags of soiled clothes in his school bag that had not been\n\tremoved;\n\t* (3) in her\n\tobservation, the child had a fear when addressed by the applicant, and adopted a\n\tsubservient voice.\n5. When\ncross-examined during the 2019 Criminal Trial, this teacher did not recant her\nstatement.\n6. Another\nteacher, in her statement made on 31 July 2019, recalled that:\n\t* (1) Child 1 had\n\tsaid words such as “I got into trouble for pooing my pants so I\n\tdidn’t get the same dinner as [Child 2]”;\n\t* (2) she had\n\ttalked with the applicant about how the school could support the child with his\n\tsoiling problem and asked her to pack\n\tmore underwear and that the applicant had\n\tsaid words to the effect of “I know he has a problem with that but he has\n\tto learn”;\n\t* (3) the school\n\twould wash the child’s underwear and send him home in the same underwear\n\tso he wouldn’t get into trouble\n\tat home;\n\t* (4) the child\n\twould run up to the applicant at the end of the day to greet her, but she would\n\tdismiss him, and he would try to keep\n\tup with her as she walked towards the\n\tgate;\n\t* (5) there was no\n\tloving interaction from the applicant to the child, and whenever she spoke about\n\thim it was negative.\n7. When\ncross-examined, the second teacher said that she did have a recollection of one\nparticular day when the applicant and Child 2\nwere walking together, with Child\n1 walking behind, chasing them and looking up. Her cross-examination revealed\nnothing further.\n8. Neither\nof the teachers directly observed harsh physical treatment or violent behaviour\nby the applicant towards the child. Overall,\ntheir statements generally refer to\nthe impressions they each formed about the relationship between the applicant\nand Child 1 and\nthe child’s concerns about any possible ramifications at\nhome for soiling himself. However, their recollections of actual conversations\nhad with the applicant were clear.\n9. We\nhave taken into account the applicant’s acknowledged frustration with the\nchild, and the evidence of two teachers concerning\nher attitude towards him and\nhis soiling problem.\n10. Against\nthat, we have taken into account the following matters:\n\t* (1) the\n\tapplicant’s denial of the alleged conduct;\n\t* (2) the absence\n\tof eye-witness evidence corroborating the allegation;\n\t* (3) the absence\n\tof a contemporaneous complaint or disclosure to the child’s siblings or\n\tteachers about what would have been\n\ta severely unpleasant and confronting\n\texperience for him on a number of levels (although we accept that he may have\n\tbeen reticent\n\tto complain about his carer whilst still in her care);\n\t* (4) that the\n\tchild’s disclosure about such a sadistic and confronting act was not made\n\tuntil the fifth occasion of making disclosures\n\t(27 November\n\t2018).\n11. His\nHonour’s remarks about the nature of some of the alleged abuse by the\napplicant are found in paragraph 113 of the Judgment:\n\n\n\n> \n> “The use of faeces smeared toothbrush, flushing his head in the toilet and\n> spraying Glen 20 in his mouth are uncommonly malicious\n> forms of abuse to be\n> perpetrated on a child which could only reflect a deep personal dislike and/or\n> sadistic tendencies.”\n> \n\n\n1. In\ngiving her evidence before this Tribunal, the applicant gave the appearance of\nnot being overly pre-occupied with concerns about\nthe child’s soiling\nbehaviour, and said she had left it to the child to manage. The teacher’s\nobservation that bags of\nsoiled clothing were left in the child’s\nschoolbag over a number of days possibly support this. However, the applicant\nacknowledged\nto this Tribunal that there were occasions when she was frustrated\nwith the child’s behaviours (not necessarily limited to\nhis soiling\nproblem) and “lost it”.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. The\nevidence of the teachers is persuasive and links the soiling problem to their\nobservation of the applicant’s detachment\nand lack of empathy towards the\nchild. Taking into account the teachers’ statements and the\napplicant’s acknowledgement\nthat she struggled with the child’s\nsoiling behaviours, we cannot ignore the possibility that the alleged conduct\noccurred.\nWe therefore find, on the balance of probabilities, it is\n*possible* that the alleged conduct occurred. We have given this finding a\nsubstantial amount of weight in assessing the applicant’s risk\ntowards the\nsafety of children.\n\n*The 2016 assault of an adult* \n\n\n1. The\napplicant’s affidavit evidence on her assault of an adult in 2016 was that\nshe clearly regretted her conduct. Under cross-examination\nin the Tribunal\nhearing, she said that she regretted that the victim of the assault had forced\nher (the applicant) to defend herself.\nHer evidence was that the assault was not\nsimply about her irritation over the victim’s failure to bring swimmers\nand a towel\nto the pool, but that there had been multiple things leading up to\nit. She said that she had admitted that she had engaged in the\nassault and had\npleaded guilty to the charge because she could not deny that she had been at the\npool at the relevant time and had\nslapped the victim, but she was adamant that\nshe had been forced to defend herself.\n2. Her\nversion of events was somewhat difficult to follow in terms of understanding the\ntiming and sequence of the asserted “multiple\nthings” and the\nsubstance of exchanges between the parties that culminated in the assault. It\nappears that an allegation had\nbeen made that the victim’s son had\n“touched” Child 2 at a swimming event and the victim had said the\napplicant\nwould “be paying for that”, the applicant asked the victim\nto stop those things from occurring, the victim went “off\nher\nrocker” about her son being investigated, the applicant’s unwell\nmother (wearing a colostomy bag) had at some time\nduring the fracas been pushed\nby the victim, the applicant was physically backed into a corner and against a\nwall, with the victim\n“coming” at her, and she defended herself by\nslapping the victim’s face.\n3. The\nCOPS narrative recorded a different version of what occurred, based on the\nvictim’s account. It also noted that the victim\nhad had little to do with\nthe applicant and had actively avoided her due to what was described as an\nunrelated matter that had occurred\nthree months before the assault, suggesting\nthat there had been unresolved issues between the parties prior to the\nassault.\n4. The\nFacts Sheet prepared by police contained further details about the incident as\nobtained from each of the parties. The applicant\nparticipated in a recorded\ninterview with police during which she said that she had acted in self-defence\nafter feeling threatened\nby the victim.\n5. We\naccept the opinion of Dr Furst that, in terms of risk assessment, the reason for\nthe applicant assaulting the victim was not relevant.\nWe also accept his opinion\nthat the applicant does not meet the threshold for emotional dysregulation.\n6. The\nsequence of events on the evening of the assault demonstrate that the applicant\nwas not able to regulate her behaviour on that\noccasion. When asked how she\nwould handle a similar circumstance in the future, her answer was that as soon\nas she encountered signs\nof anger in a third party, she would remove herself and\nnot become involved. We are satisfied that the applicant’s deep remorse\nover the incident and her humiliation and embarrassment over the court\nproceedings will serve as a deterrent against any risk of\nrepetitive like\nbehaviour.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. Taking\nthose factors and Dr Furst’s opinion into account, and since there is only\none incident of this nature in her criminal\nhistory and it is arguable that the\nassault occurred after provocation, it is not safe to conclude that the\napplicant may not be\nfully in charge of her emotional responses to irritating or\naggressive behaviour in a domestic violence context. We therefore have\nnot taken\nthe incident into account when assessing her risk to the safety of\nchildren.\n\n*Findings in respect of government agency\ninvestigations*\n\n\n1. The\nmere fact of an allegation having been made is not sufficient to raise an\nargument that the Tribunal should conclude the possibility\nthat the conduct\noccurred. In assessing an allegation, we are obliged to consider the seriousness\nof the allegation and the strength\nof the evidence supporting it. Where there is\nno substantiating evidence, it is not safe to conclude the truth or falsity of\nan allegation,\nor the possibility that the alleged conduct occurred.\n2. The\nmaterial before the Children’s Guardian and this Tribunal concerning\ninvestigations undertaken by various government agencies\nand Wesley Dalmar is\nnot comprehensive. In a number of instances, only the outcomes, and not the full\nrecord, are available. Some\nreports note that material is\nmissing.\n\n**First investigation by DOCS – Allegations of\nphysical abuse of Child T and Child C, and withholding food from Child T**\n\n\n1. In\n2006, DOCS investigated 7 allegations that the applicant physically abused Child\nT in her care, did not provide enough food to\nhim and withheld food from him as\npunishment. The time period for the allegations was said to be in late 2004 and\nbetween late 2004\nand early 2006. One of the allegations also asserted that the\napplicant smacked Child C (her adopted son) on the bottom, arms and\nlegs as a\nform of punishment.\n2. All\nseven allegations were determined by DOCS to be “Not Sustained –\nFalse”.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. There\nbeing no further material before this Tribunal other than the outcome of the\ninvestigation, it is not possible to assess the\nmerit of the allegations. In the\nabsence of any supporting evidence either way, the possibility that the alleged\nconduct occurred\ncannot be considered. Accordingly, we do not give any weight to\nthe allegations when assessing whether the applicant is a\nrisk.\n\n**Second investigation by FACS – Allegation of\nexcessive discipline of Child 1** \n\n\n1. In\nFebruary 2014, FACS advised the applicant of the result of its investigation\ninto 5 allegations against her concerning Child 1.\nWe note that, at this time,\nthe child was still in the care of the applicant. The investigation relied upon\ncasework records and\nthe applicant’s discussion with casework staff. It\nwas alleged that on 30 August 2011 the applicant became cross at Child 1\nfor\nsoiling his pants and pushed him on the forehead with her hand and made him\nclean his poo off the floor using a wet wipe and\nthen put the soiled wipe in his\nmouth. It was also alleged that “on occasions” the applicant smacked\nthe child on the\nbottom for breaking toys and not cleaning his soiled\nunderpants. On another occasion, it was alleged she pushed him, causing him\nto\nfall on hard grass. A fifth allegation asserted that the applicant had on one\noccasion several years previously smacked a child\n(not identified) on the\nhand.\n2. The\nfifth allegation was found to not constitute reportable conduct and the\nremaining allegations were found to not be\nsustained.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. There\nis insufficient evidence available for this Tribunal to assess the merit of the\nallegations or consider the possibility that\nthe alleged conduct occurred. We do\nnot give any weight to the allegations when assessing whether the applicant is a\nrisk.\n\n**Third investigation by FACS re sexualised behaviours of 3\nchildren and safety plan**\n\n\n1. In\nSeptember/October 2015, when he was no longer in the care of the applicant,\nChild 1 attended the Liverpool JIRT in relation to\nallegations that Child C had\nindecently assaulted him and his twin sister, but Child 1 declined to be\nformally interviewed. Child\nC was 14 at the time, and Child 1 and Child 2 had\nturned 12. A file noted dated 8 October 2015 recorded that Child 1 had asserted\nthat Child C and his sister were having “S-E-X” and that all 3\nchildren were running naked from their bedrooms into each\nother’s\nbedrooms. A file note dated 13 October 2015 recorded allegations by Child 1 that\nChild C had done something “disgusting”\nto him, including squeezing\nChild 1’s penis and that Child C had put his penis in Child 1’s\nanus.\n2. Child\n2 was interviewed on 9 October 2015 and, when asked whether anyone had touched\nher in places they shouldn’t, she answered\n“yes”. However, she\nbecame very upset and refused to identify who had touched her. She acknowledged\nthat something had\nhappened around one month before at home, and she was\nfrightened to say anything.\n3. Following\nthe interview with Child 2, FACS spoke with the applicant who recalled two\nincidents involving the child. First, at the\nspecial Olympics, the child had\nbeen touched on the leg by a male competitor. Second, around 3 months\npreviously, Child C had entered\nChild 2’s room and lay on top of her.\nFACS’ file note recorded that the applicant said that Child C only did to\nChild\n2 what Child 1 did to Child C.\n4. In\nher affidavit, the applicant acknowledged that Child 2 had run naked into Child\nC’s room, and that she had counselled them\nboth about that behaviour. Her\nevidence was that she never viewed the incident or any prior incidents as\nsexualised behaviour, and\nthat she believed that Child C had the developmental\nage of a 7 year old at the time. Her evidence was also that she did not believe\nthe allegations.\n5. The\nallegations of sexual abuse perpetrated by Child C against Child 1 and Child 2\ncould not be substantiated because Child 1 refused\nto be interviewed and Child 2\nrefused to engage whilst being interviewed.\n6. Nonetheless,\nFACS concluded that the *likelihood* of sexual abuse occurring was very\nhigh and developed a safety plan for Child 2 to remain in the placement.\n7. FACS\ntook the view that the applicant did not adhere to the safety plan. The\napplicant’s evidence was that she had complied\nwith the safety plan and\nhad not been informed that there was any issue over compliance with the plan. In\nany event, a decision was\nmade to remove Child 2 from the applicant’s care\nin November 2015. Following this, the applicant’s carer authorisation\nwas\nrestricted so that only Child 3 remained in her care.\n8. The\ninvestigation report into the sexualised behaviour of Child C against Child 1\nand Child 2 was not available to us. By the applicant’s\nown evidence, she\nwas informed by the Reportable Conduct Unit that Child 2 was at risk of sexual\nand psychological harm in the applicant’s\ncare and the applicant was\nidentified as a person of interest.\n9. Having\nregard to the statements made by Child 2 and the applicant’s\nacknowledgment of what occurred (without believing there\nwas sexual intent), we\nfind that the allegations made by Child 1 about the adopted son’s\nsexualised behaviour were truthfully\nmade.\n10. We\nhave concern that the applicant acted protectively towards her adopted son,\nexcusing his behaviour on the basis of his developmental\nage, and did not act\nprotectively towards Child 1 or Child 2. Indeed, she defended her adopted\nson’s behaviour on the basis\nthat his slow development meant he did not\nhave any sexual intent, and that he had merely copied the behaviour of Child\n1.\n11. The\napplicant’s evidence before this Tribunal was that Child 2 was not at risk\nof harm by her adopted son because there was\nno sexual intent by him, and she\nbelieved that Child 2 was thus not at risk in the applicant’s care.\n12. There\nwas no acknowledgment by her that, even if her adopted son at the age of 14 had\nno sexual intent because of his delayed development,\nhis sexualised behaviour\nnonetheless may have placed Child 2, who had a traumatic history of sexual\nabuse, at risk of sexual, physical,\nemotional and psychological harm.\n13. The\napplicant’s firm opinion on this issue demonstrated a lack of insight into\nthe seriousness of the reported behaviours. Her\nviews reflect her failure to be\nprotective towards a prepubescent girl whom she knew was vulnerable. We find\nthis to be a matter\nof deep concern.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. We\nfind that the sexualised behaviours in the household occurred, and that the\napplicant failed to act protectively towards children\nin her care, exposing them\nto emotional and psychological harm.\n2. We\nhave given this matter a substantial amount of weight in assessing the applicant\nto be a risk to the safety of children.\n\n**Fourth investigation by\nWD – Allegations of excessive punishment and physical abuse of Child\n1**\n\n\n1. Wesley\nDalmar investigated numerous allegations made by Child 1 (after leaving the\napplicant’s care) concerning ill-treatment,\nneglect and physical assault.\nIts final risk assessment report dated 29 July 2016 refers to various interviews\nheld with the applicant,\nher husband, Child 1 and Child 3. We also understand\nthat statements made by Child 2 were taken into account.\n\n*Allegations by Child 1*\n\n\n1. Child\n1 was interviewed on 26 February 2015 (aged 11 at the time) in which he made\nnumerous allegations pertaining to both himself\nand his sister. The allegations\nincluded:\n\t* (1) that\n\tbreakfast was withheld from him (being told to eat at school) and withheld if he\n\tmisbehaved;\n\t* (2) that on one\n\toccasion he recalled being excluded and denied food such as McDonalds when\n\tothers were having take-away;\n\t* (3) that he was\n\tmade to sit on the stairs for hours and not move;\n\t* (4) that the\n\tapplicant told him not to speak to the teachers or anyone else or they would get\n\tinto trouble;\n\t* (5) that both he\n\tand his sister were hit by the applicant and Child 3;\n\t* (6) being locked\n\toutside the house;\n\t* (7) being hit\n\twith a black leather belt because the applicant thought that he had sworn\n\t(asserting that he had been hit 4 times with\n\tthe belt, and then that it had only\n\toccurred once);\n\t* (8) that the\n\tapplicant gets angry and screams at the children and hits them with a wooden\n\tspoon.\n\n*Evidence of the applicant*\n\n\n1. On\n7 December 2015, the applicant participated in a reportable conduct interview.\nHer evidence was that she never hit any child with\na belt, but that Child 1 was\nhit by his twin sister “every day”. She said that the other children\nwould hit Child 1 from\ntime to time, but that only Child 2 hit him every day.\nShe asserted that Child 2 “slaps, hits, kicks, bites, you name it”.\nWe note that, at the time of this interview, Child 2 had been removed from the\napplicant’s care.\n2. The\napplicant denied owning a wooden spoon, insisting that she had only ever owned\nplastic spoons. In cross-examination, she emphasised\nthis point, saying that she\nconsidered wooden spoons to be unhygienic. Wesley Dalmar inspected the\napplicant’s utensils drawer\nin her kitchen and found no evidence of a\nwooden spoon.\n3. On\nthe subject of discipline, she said that Child 1 would be asked to sit on the\nstairs for time out, as a discipline, but that if\nhe stayed longer, it was his\nown choice because he liked to read or play with his lego on the stairs. She\nacknowledged that once\nor twice a month he may sit on the stairs from breakfast\nuntil lunch, playing.\n4. The\napplicant was adamant that food was never withheld from Child 1 and that if he\nrefused the food including take-away that was offered,\nshe would provide him\nwith a sandwich. She recalled an incident when Indian take-away had been\nordered, however Child 1 refused to\neat that, and also that he “threw the\nsandwich” that was offered to him, and so he went to bed without\neating.\n\n*Evidence of the applicant’s husband*\n\n\n1. The\napplicant’s husband was interviewed on 18 April 2016. He said that he had\nnot ever seen the applicant hit the children,\nand said there was no wooden spoon\nin the house. He said “No I don’t hit my own kids when they do wrong\nthings”.\nHe said that they “dawdle” a bit when going out and\nthat he would lead them to the door with his hand at the back of\ntheir head. On\nthe subject of whether the children were hit with a belt, his statement was\nreported as being “Not in this house.\nMight have been mucking around.\nUsually when I am getting dressed.”\n\n*Evidence of Child\n3*\n\n\n1. Child\n3 appears to have been interviewed on at least two occasions, on 7 December 2015\nand 4 March 2016, at the age of 8. He spoke\nfreely and clearly, saying many\ntimes that Child 1 had been smacked on the head for digging up and pulling out\ngrass and if he wasn’t\ndoing what the applicant asked. He also recalled an\noccasion when Child 1 had to have a sandwich because he had been “pulling\nthe grass out”. He also said that the applicant didn’t talk to Child\n1, and that she only spoke to himself and Child\nC. He said that Child 1 was\nalways naughty, digging holes, pulling out grass, lying and hurting people.\n2. In\nhis interview on 4 March 2016, his statements were more detailed, saying that\nChild 1 would get a “smack on the head”\nevery day because he was\nnaughty, and also saying “my dad used to go WACK. Sometimes dad smacks him\nwith the belt and hands”.\nHe said that Child 1 got into trouble\n“every single day” and that every time he was naughty the applicant\nused her hands\nto smack him. He physically demonstrated the use of an open hand\nin a slapping motion. He also said that Child 2 was smacked “a\nlot”,\nwith hands because she was always lying and when she was found stealing. Child 3\nmade inconsistent statements about whether\nthe applicant only smacked with her\nhands or whether she had used a belt, but was generally consistent in describing\nthe number of\ntimes that Child 1 was hit for being naughty.\n3. On\nthe subject of discipline, he said that he sometimes got into trouble but\nnothing much happened. He said that his older brother\nhad to sit at the bottom\nof the staircase for “the whole day, or something”. Child 3 said\nthat he himself had to sit\nat the bottom of the staircase once but he\ncouldn’t remember the reason, but that it was for “5 minutes, or\nsomething”.\nHis statements, despite occasional inconsistencies, generally\ncorroborate the applicant’s evidence regarding discipline.\n4. Child\n3’s recorded interview on 29 March 2019 occurred 3 years after his\nprevious statement about the physical abuse metered\nout to his older brother. He\nwas then aged 11 and had recently been removed from the applicant’s care.\nHe repeated his statement\nthat his older brother got into trouble “every\nsingle day” for things such as “pulling out the\ngrass”.\n\n*Evidence of Child 2*\n\n\n1. Child\n2 was interviewed on 29 March 2019 in connection with the 2019 Criminal Trial.\nAt that time, she was no longer in the care of\nthe applicant. She was 15 and had\nnot been living in the household for more than 3 years. On the subject of\ndiscipline in the household,\nshe said that they didn’t really get in\ntrouble a lot but that, if they did, they sat in the time-out spot for 5 or 10\nminutes,\neither outside or inside. She said that the punishment was the same for\neveryone, corroborating the applicant’s evidence.\n2. Wesley\nDalmar sustained the following allegations :\n\t* (1) that Child 1\n\twas made to sit on the stairs for hours and not allowed to move;\n\t* (2) that Child 1\n\twas hit every day and all the time;\n\t* (3) that the\n\tapplicant hits with her hands;\n\t* (4) that the\n\tapplicant hits children with a belt.\n3. Wesley\nDalmar’s report is incomplete, with missing information. It is therefore\ndifficult to assess with confidence the weight\nof evidence upon which some of\nthe allegations were sustained.\n4. After\nbeing informed of Wesley Dalmar’s findings, the DoE undertook its own\nassessment. The applicant denied the allegations,\nsubmitting the following\narguments:\n\t* (1) that a\n\t“sustained” finding did not mean the conduct had occurred;\n\t* (2) that the\n\tchances of the conduct as alleged occurring in a home seemed unlikely;\n\t* (3) that she was\n\tstill an authorised foster carer and in the process of applying for\n\tadoption;\n\t* (4) that the\n\tchances of the allegation happening in a school setting with so many\n\t‘eyes’ on her is highly unlikely.\n5. The\nDoE declined to make findings of ill-treatment or assault on the basis that the\nsufficiency of evidence and quality of the agency’s\ninvestigation was\ndisputed. However, the department expressed concern about the nature of the\nallegations and issued a direction\nto the applicant in the following\nterms:\n\n\n\n> \n> “I now direct you not to come into any unnecessary physical contact with\n> any child or student in your care, whether in a professional\n> or personal\n> capacity and environment.\n> I further direct you not to engage in any conduct towards any child or student\n> that could reasonably be taken to be intimidating,\n> offensive or harassing in\n> nature.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n1. We\nacknowledge that various statements by Child 3 contain inconsistencies. The\napplicant sought to discredit Child 3’s evidence\non the basis that he was\nonly 8, imaginative, had ADHD and liked to please others by telling them what he\nthought they wanted to\nhear. We do not accept that proposition as one to dismiss\nthe child’s statements entirely. He was still in the applicant’s\ncare at the time of his interviews and his statements appear to be\nstraight-forward and transparent. He had a close bond with the\napplicant. A more\ncautious or knowing child who suspected if they said anything negative about\ntheir carer that might jeopardise\ntheir placement, might be expected to withhold\nstatements about the carer administering physical punishment. For that reason,\nwe\naccept that his statements were based on his own observations and were plain,\ntruthful accounts of a young child. By the time he\nparticipated in a recorded\ninterview in March 2019 he was 11 and, after three years, he persisted in his\ndescription of Child 1 being\npunished for being naughty.\n\n*Finding\nre excessive punishment on stairs*\n\n\n1. We\naccept the applicant’s evidence that Child 1 liked to sit on the stairs\nfor hours, playing by himself, even if that activity\nhad been instigated as a\n“time-out” measure. The evidence of Child 2 and Child 3 generally\ncorroborate the applicant’s\nevidence. There is insufficient evidence to\ncorroborate Child 1’s allegation that sitting on the stairs for hours was\na punishment.\nWe find that the allegation is not founded, and afford no weight\nto it in assessing the applicant’s risk.\n\n*Finding re leather\nbelt and wooden spoon* \n\n\n1. We\nhave previously addressed the allegation that a leather belt was used to punish\nChild 1.\n2. The\ncare history for the twins noted that their birth father had hit all children\nwith a wooden spoon. It is therefore possible that\nChild 1’s allegation\nhas confused other traumatic physical abuse in his life and attributed it to the\napplicant. We find that\nthe wooden spoon allegation is not founded and afford no\nweight to it in assessing the applicant’s risk.\n\n*Finding re\nphysical abuse*\n\n\n1. However,\nwhen considering Child 1’s very first disclosure to the FACS Caseworker in\nDecember 2014 that at least in his new placement\nhe wasn’t hit every day,\nand taking into account the repeated corroborating statements of Child 3, we\nfind that the applicant\nsmacked Child 1 frequently with her hands. The\nexperience of being repeatedly smacked on his head, would have caused emotional\nand\npsychological harm to the child.\n2. We\nafford a substantial amount of weight to this finding and assess the applicant\nas being a risk to the safety of children.\n\n**Fifth investigation by\nFACS – Allegation concerning contact visit**\n\n\n1. This\nmatter was not pressed by the respondent. The applicant relied upon the\nrespondent’s concession that Wesley Dalmar had\nbeen consulted over a\ncontact visit involving the three siblings and Child C, and had apologised for\nits error.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. Accordingly,\nwe did not take this matter into account when assessing the applicant’s\nrisk.\n\n**Sixth investigation by WD – Allegation of\nwithholding food as punishment**\n\n\n1. The\nRefusal Decision referred to an adverse finding by Wesley Dalmar after\ninvestigating allegations by Child 1 apparently made in\n2012, 2015 and 2016 that\nthe applicant had withheld food and used food as punishment in response to his\nsoiling behaviours. Wesley\nDalmar made an adverse finding, apparently largely\nupon reliance of statements provided by teachers at the child’s schools.\nWe note that this allegation and investigation appears to be the same as the\nallegation numbered 11 in the Ninth Investigation by\nWesley Dalmar, with\nfindings made available on 8 September 2021.\n2. The\napplicant denied the allegations. She said that she was informed of the\nallegations against her but did not recall participating\nin an interview.\n3. Both\nChild 2 and Child 3 denied knowledge of their brother missing out on treat meals\nas a consequence of soiling himself.\n4. We\nconsidered statements provided by two teachers at a school where Child 1 and\nChild 2 attended, to assess the allegations.\n5. In\nher statement dated 31 July 2019, one class teacher recorded that:\n\t* (1) in a\n\tconversation with the applicant at the end of a school day, after being told\n\tthat Child 1 had not had a great day, the applicant\n\tsaid her punishment for him\n\twould be eggplant for dinner while everyone else would have pizza, and the\n\tfollowing week she confirmed\n\tthat she had indeed given him eggplant for dinner\n\tand she found it “hilarious” that he had liked it;\n\t* (2) in another\n\tconversation the applicant said that if Child 1 had not cleaned his room or did\n\tsomething wrong, she would use food\n\tas an incentive;\n\t* (3) if the child\n\thad not eaten all the food in his lunchbox, such as a half-eaten apple, it was\n\treturned the next day, and his lunchbox\n\twas occasionally filled with\n\tcockroaches.\n6. When\ncross-examined during the trial, this teacher had a very clear memory of her\nconversation with the applicant about the child\nhaving eggplant, intended to be\na punishment.\n7. In\nconnection with the Shower Toothbrush Allegation, we have already considered the\nstatement of another teacher. That statement also\nrecalled that:\n\t* (1) on several\n\toccasions, Child 1 was found looking for food from bins and in her view, he was\n\tstarving;\n\t* (2) he was not\n\tallowed the food that the rest of the family were having, as punishment for\n\tsoiling himself or not cleaning his room.\n8. When\ncross-examined, this teacher’s statement that Child 1 was punished for\nsoiling himself by not being allowed food the rest\nof the family had, was not\nchallenged.\n9. The\napplicant denied the allegations. She had no recollection of plastic bags\ncontaining soiled underpants piling up in the child’s\nschoolbag, saying\nthe children were responsible for unpacking their own bags. Her evidence is that\nshe holds the view that it is\nnot appropriate to withhold food as a form of\npunishment.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. On\nthe material before us, we are satisfied on the balance of probabilities, that\nit is *possible* the applicant excluded Child 1 from treat meals as\npunishment for his behaviour or soiling problem. Being excluded from family\ntreat\nmeals, particularly for soiling problems that are beyond the control of a\nchild, would likely have a severe, enduring, negative impact\nupon child’s\nemotional and psychological well-being.\n2. We\ngive this a moderate amount of weight in assessing that the applicant poses a\nrisk to the safety of children.\n\n**Seventh investigation by FACS\n– Allegation concerning Child 3**\n\n\n1. There\nappears to have been an allegation that on 21 May 2019 Child 3 made a casual\ncomment to his new foster carer that he had sometimes\nshowered with the\napplicant’s husband. There was no suggestion that the child had been\nabused in the shower.\n2. In\nan interview on 11 July 2019, the child stated that he showered on his own and\nanswered “no” when asked if he ever\nshowered or bathed with anyone.\nOtherwise, he made no disclosures.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. There\nis scant material before this Tribunal concerning this allegation. Accordingly,\nit is not possible to consider whether the conduct\noccurred, or the possibility\nthat the conduct occurred, and we have not afforded any weight to these matters\nin assessing the applicant’s\nrisk.\n\n**Eighth investigation by\nDCJ – Allegations the subject of 2019 Criminal Trial**\n\n\n1. DCJ\nconducted an investigation into a number of allegations against the applicant\nfollowing an interview with Child 1 on 21 February\n2019. The allegations appear\nto mirror those that were subsequently the subject of the 2019 Criminal Trial\nand included additional\nallegations.\n2. FACS’\nrecords reported that Child 1 disclosed multiple incidents of physical harm\nincluding two incidents of indecent sexual\nharm perpetrated by the applicant. We\nare not aware of an allegation of indecent assault other than the matter\npreviously addressed.\n3. FACS\nsubstantiated the allegations based on the child’s interview. However, the\nchild’s evidence was not tested, no other\nindependent witnesses (such as\nChild 2 and Child 3) were interviewed, and the applicant was not interviewed.\nFACS did not provide\na detailed report on its investigation.\n4. We\nhave previously assessed the allegations that were the subject of the 2019\nCriminal Trial. In the absence of evidence to support\nadditional allegations\nthat may have been investigated by FACS, we make no\nfindings.\n\n**Ninth investigation by WD - Multiple allegations\nincluding those that were the subject of 2019 Criminal Trial**\n\n\n1. After\nthe conclusion of the 2019 Criminal Trial, Wesley Dalmar conducted its own\ninvestigation into 11 allegations, some of which\nhad been the subject of the\n2019 Criminal Trial.\n2. The\nallegations and findings made by Wesley Dalmar are set out in the table\nbelow:\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **No.** | **Allegation** | **Finding** |\n| 1. | That the applicant hit a child in her care with a thong (Noting that this\nallegation appears to have been possibly confused with an\nallegation that the\napplicant’s husband threatened to hit Child 3 with a belt for not brushing\nhis teeth) | Non-Adverse |\n| 2. | That the applicant regularly co-slept with a child (Child 3) in her\ncare | Non-Adverse |\n| 3. | That the applicant regularly allowed a child (Child 3) in her care to touch\nher breasts | Non-Adverse |\n| 4. | That the applicant made a child in her care (Child 1) brush their teeth\nwith faeces on their toothbrush | Adverse |\n| 5. | That the applicant made a child in her care (Child 1) touch her\nvagina | Non-Adverse |\n| 6. | That the applicant instructed a child in her care (Child 3) to strike\nanother child in her care (Child 1) with a rake resulting in\na laceration to\ntheir scalp | Non-Adverse |\n| 7. | That the applicant smashed a plate over a child (Child 1) in her care | Non-Adverse |\n| 8. | That the applicant flushed the head of a child (Child 1) in her care in a\ntoilet bowl | Non-Adverse |\n| 9. | That the applicant removed the clothes from a child in her care (Child 1)\nwho had soiled themselves whilst in a car park, resulting\nin the child being\ndriven home naked | Non-Adverse |\n| 10. | That the applicant made a child in her care (Child 1) stand naked on her\nfront veranda for five minutes | Non-Adverse |\n| 11. | That the applicant used exclusionary repercussions as a consequence to a\nchild in her care | Adverse |\n\n\n1. In\nconsidering the allegations, Wesley Dalmar relied upon the available material\nfrom the 2019 Criminal Trial and interviews with\nthe applicant, her husband and\nthe three siblings who had been in her care.\n\n**Allegation 1 –\nPhysical punishments using a thong or belt**\n\n\n1. Despite\napparently making a disclosure that the applicant had hit him once with a thong,\nChild 3 subsequently withdrew the allegation\nand denied that the applicant was\nphysical with him if he did the wrong thing. The applicant denied the allegation\nin an interview\non 10 June 2022.\n2. On\n31 May 2021, Child 3 specifically denied having been threatened with a\nbelt.\n3. In\nan interview on 10 June 2022, the applicant’s husband denied an allegation\nthat he had threatened to hit Child 3 with a belt\nfor not brushing his teeth,\nsaying “I don’t recall that ever happening”.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. Having\nregard to Child 3’s inconsistent statements, and the absence of other\ncorroborating evidence, we find that the allegations\nhave no foundation. We have\nnot given them any weight in assessing the applicant’s\nrisk.\n\n**Allegation 2 – Co-sleeping**\n\n\n1. Relying\nupon interviews with the applicant, her husband and Child 3, it appears that the\npractice of the child being in the applicant’s\nbed was limited to when he\nwas young (3 or 4) or not well, and only until ten or ten thirty at night. After\nthat time, more often\nthan not, the child was toileted and transferred to his\nown bed. He rarely stayed in their bed the whole night. There was no suggestion\nthat the child and the foster carers were not clothed and no suggestion of\ninappropriate touching or behaviour occurring. We accept\nthe evidence of the\napplicant and her husband.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. On\nbalance, we do not find that the applicant and her husband regularly co-slept\nwith Child 3 such that any harm was caused or could\nhave been caused.\nAccordingly, we have not taken the allegation into account when assessing the\napplicant’s risk.\n\n**Allegation 3 – Allowing a child to\ntouch the applicant’s breasts**\n\n\n1. The\nallegation that Child 3 was permitted to touch the applicant’s breasts\nappears to have emanated from an episode when he\naccidentally touched his\nsister’s breasts when they were jumping on a trampoline. Child 2 disclosed\nthat after the accidental\ntouch, Child 3 had said that he did it all the time\nwith the applicant, sometimes after a shower and sometimes dressed.\n2. In\nan interview with police, Child 3 denied knowledge of any incident where he\ntouched his sister’s breasts on the trampoline\nand denied being allowed to\ntouch the applicant’s breasts.\n3. In\nan interview on 10 June 2022, the applicant denied allowing the child to touch\nher breasts, stating “[Child 3] is not allowed\nto touch my breasts, never\nhas and never will be”. Her affidavit evidence is that she did not allow\nthe child to touch her\nbreasts at any time.\n4. Child\n2’s disclosure of the incident on the trampoline and her assertion as to\nwhat her younger brother had said about touching\nthe applicant’s breasts\nis surprising when viewed against her general reluctance to discuss her time in\nthe care of the applicant.\n5. In\nlight of Child 3’s subsequent denial that he had disclosed any activity to\nhis sister, his denial that an incident had occurred\non the trampoline and his\ndenial that the applicant had allowed him to touch her breasts, there is no\nother corroborating evidence\nto support the primary\nallegation.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. We\nregard the allegation as groundless and have not afforded any weight to it in\nassessing the applicant’s risk.\n\n**Allegation 4 –\nToothbrush allegation**\n\n\n1. We\nhave already assessed this allegation and found, on the balance of\nprobabilities, that it is *possible* the conduct\noccurred.\n\n**Allegation 5 – Indecent assault**\n\n\n1. We\nhave already assessed this allegation and found that the conduct did not occur\nand there was no possibility that the conduct\noccurred.\n\n**Allegation 6 – Encouraging Child 3 to physically\nassault Child 1 with a rake**\n\n\n1. Child\n1 alleged on a number of occasions via various reporting paths that the\napplicant had encouraged his younger brother to hit\nhim over the head with a\nmetal rake. In his interview with police, he added that he had been hit in the\nhead “a couple of times”.\nHe asserted that the applicant had told\nChild C to take the rake “off the roof” and give it to Child 3, and\ntold Child\n3 to hit Child 1 in the head with it. He said he did not know the\nreason for the alleged incident.\n2. The\napplicant denied that she had encouraged the younger sibling to hit his brother.\nShe also gave details which were inconsistent\nwith Child 1’s account of\nthe location of the rake.\n3. It\nis evident from conversations with Child 2 on 21 December 2018 and again on 9\nJanuary 2019 with FACS and Wesley Dalmar caseworkers,\nthat Child 2 was extremely\nreluctant to talk about her experience in the placement with the applicant.\nHowever, she openly described\nan incident where her younger brother had\nretaliated against “annoying” behaviour by her older brother. He had\npicked\nup a rake and hit his brother on the back of the head, such that it\nrequired medical attention. She was clear that it had not been\nsomething that\nthe applicant had encouraged Child 3 to do.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. On\nbalance, we give weight to the applicant’s denial and the evidence of\nChild 2 whose explanation of the incident was clear\nand articulate. We find that\nthe allegation against the applicant (as opposed to the allegation that Child 3\nhad hit his brother\nin the head with a rake) was not well founded. We have not\ntaken it into account when assessing her risk.\n\n**Allegation 7\n– Smashing a plate over Child 1’s head**\n\n\n1. We\nhave already addressed this allegation and found that the conduct did not occur\nand that there was no possibility that the conduct\noccurred. We have not given\nit any weight in assessing the applicant’s risk.\n\n**Allegation\n8 – Flushing Child 1’s head in the toilet bowl**\n\n\n1. We\nhave already addressed this allegation and found that the conduct did not occur\nand that there was no possibility that the conduct\noccurred. We have not given\nit any weight in assessing the applicant’s risk.\n\n**Allegation\n9 – Removing Child 1’s clothing in a car park because of\nsoiling**\n\n\n1. Child\n1 asserted that the applicant had removed his clothing in a child centre car\npark and driven him home whilst he was naked, in\nthe car with his siblings.\n2. The\napplicant denied the allegation in her interviews with Police and Wesley\nDalmar.\n3. Neither\nof his siblings corroborated the allegation.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. On\nthe evidence before us, we find that the allegation has no foundation. We have\nnot taken it into account when assessing the applicant’s\nrisk.\n\n**Allegation 10 – Requiring a child to stand naked on\nverandah as punishment for wetting his pants**\n\n\n1. Child\n1 alleged that the applicant made him stand naked on the front verandah of their\nhouse after he had wet his pants. He asserted\nthat his siblings had witnessed\nthe incident.\n2. The\napplicant denied the allegation. Neither of Child 1’s siblings\ncorroborated the allegation, and denied witnessing the\nincident.\n\n*Finding*\n\n\n1. On\nthe evidence before us, we find that the allegation has no foundation. We have\nnot taken it into account when assessing the applicant’s\nrisk.\n\n**Allegation 11 – Excluding Child 1 from family treat\nmeals**\n\n\n1. This\nallegation has already been addressed in relation to the Sixth\nInvestigation.\n\n*Overall assessment of risk*\n\n\n**Assessing the applicant’s approach to working as a carer**\n\n\n1. Whilst\na carer’s authorisation may be granted subject to conditions, a person who\nis granted a clearance can work in child-related\nemployment without any\nrestrictions. A higher standard is applied to foster care because children are\nsubjected to an environment\nin which carers have a high degree of control 24/7\nover the children placed with them, and the potential for harm to be caused is\nincreased.\n2. It\nwas apparent to this Tribunal, given the number of children in the household\nwith high, complex needs (noting the various disabilities\nand vulnerabilities of\nChild C, Child 1, Child 2 and Child 3) and her employment as a Teacher’s\nAide, coupled with the fact\nthat her husband worked very long hours out of their\nhome, that the applicant was the primary carer and led a very busy life.\n3. Overall,\nshe gave her evidence before this Tribunal in a dispassionate, matter-of-fact\nmanner, without embellishment. She presented\nas a person who goes about her day\nbalancing multiple and competing priorities as efficiently and pragmatically as\nshe can manage,\ndespite minor annoyances. There is no doubt that she took a\ndisciplined approach in optimising her skills and experience to work\nas a carer\nfor nearly 16 years, and a Teacher’s Aide for almost 27 years. By all\nappearances, she was intuitive and resourceful,\nundertaking her responsibilities\nas a carer without a great deal of advice or assistance from caseworkers. She\ndid this almost unsupported,\nsince her husband worked long hours out of the\nhome.\n4. We\ndo not underestimate the logistical arrangements associated with bringing up 3\nsons as well as 3 sibling foster children, whilst\nalso providing short term care\nfor around 120 children and medium to longer term care for 6 other children over\na period of 15 years.\nOverlay that with the applicant’s employment as a\nTeacher’s Aide, and the organisational skills and energy required to\nplan\nand implement routines at home for children with high needs, and attend to the\nschool drop-off and pick-up routines, would likely\ndeplete any parent. And yet,\nthis applicant also coached soccer and baseball. She was motivated to give her\nadopted son the opportunity\nto train for potential participation in Special\nOlympic swimming. She put her family first and, by her own testimony, her needs\nwere\nalways last in the pile of things to do.\n5. Although\nshe had two sons of her own, she and her husband demonstrated their commitment,\nlove and empathy towards a child with disability\nin their care by proceeding to\nformally adopt him. Her natural compassion was evident to this Tribunal when she\nexpressed in very\nsimple terms her joy in being able to help the damaged\nchildren in her care achieve, and take pride in, relatively easy tasks such\nas\nproperly using cutlery at dinner and learning to dress themselves. In describing\nher achievements with Child 1, her comments were\nunreserved and emotional in\nacknowledging that she felt she had never succeeded in teaching him to choose\nappropriate clothing, and\nshe then added:\n\n\n\n> \n> “I gave him everything that I could and I gave him everything that I gave\n> the other kids”.\n> \n\n\n1. Material\nbefore us demonstrates that the applicant’s carer authorisation was\nfavourably reviewed by agency personnel who supervised\nthe placement. The\napplicant was found to have demonstrated a capacity to meet the needs of each\nchild in her care. The other children\ndid not express any concerns in the\nplacement and the applicant’s only concerns were that she did not receive\nthe support she\nwould have liked from the relevant agencies. In a five-year\nreview, she and her husband were described as “wonderful advocates\nfor the\nchildren in their care when needed”, that they were “very family\nfocused” and “treat[ed] the children\nas part of their\nfamily”.\n2. On\nthe subject of Child 1 soiling himself, she projected an attitude of being\nunconcerned by what must have been, at times, frustrating\nand unpleasant to deal\nwith. She said that the child had learned to clean himself up and that she\ndirected him to do so as and when\nrequired, without seeking to discipline him.\nShe projected an attitude of calmness, and that the episodes of Child 1 soiling\nhimself\nwere so commonplace that she was unperturbed, and not agitated.\n3. However,\nin material before this Tribunal, there is evidence that the applicant disliked\nChild 1 and indeed it was reported that she\nhad said she hated him.\n4. His\nHonour’s remarks about the nature of some of the alleged abuse by the\napplicant are found in paragraph 113 of the Judgment:\n\n\n\n> \n> “The use of faeces smeared toothbrush, flushing his head in the toilet and\n> spraying Glen 20 in his mouth are uncommonly malicious\n> forms of abuse to be\n> perpetrated on a child which could only reflect a deep personal dislike and/or\n> sadistic tendencies.”\n> \n\n\n1. The\ndocumentary evidence included a risk of significant harm report on 31 August\n2011 (when Child 1 was still in the care of the applicant)\nrecording that Child\n2 had insisted that a mark on her brother’s forehead had resulted from the\napplicant pushing him because\nhe had soiled his pants at school and had refused\nto wash them. This lends support to the proposition that the applicant harboured\nhostility towards Child 1 because of his soiling problem.\n2. The\nassertion by Child 1 that white marks around his mouth had resulted from him\nsucking the penis of a teacher at school appears\nto have ultimately been the\nfinal straw that drove the applicant to relinquish the care of Child 1. An\ninvestigation by the JRU,\nfound the allegation to be a fabrication She could no\nlonger cope with his sexualised behaviours and allegations about sexual conduct\nwith other people.\n3. The\napplicant’s relationships with both Child 1 and Child 2 were observed to\nbe complex. As early as 2010, it was clear that\nthe applicant thought Child 1\nwas a liar and perpetrator and that Child 2 was a liar and a bully. They were\nnot relationships in\nwhich the applicant and her husband felt they could express\naffection because they recognised early on that offering affection could\nbe\nmisunderstood by the children as a sexual advance. His Honour’s comments\nin paragraph 98 of the Judgment about the potential\nrelationship dynamics in\ndealing with a child who had previously been abused are insightful:\n\n\n\n> \n> “The allegations as a whole depict a new, abusive chapter in [Child\n> 1’s] already blighted life. There is no doubt [Child\n> 1] would be a\n> challenge to anyone entrusted with his care after his removal from his birth\n> parents. Occasional responses by a carer\n> which might be categorised as excessive\n> discipline or as a frustrated, spontaneous loss of control in the face of\n> testing behaviour\n> might be understandable but the picture emerging from the\n> prosecution case is one of sustained, deliberate cruelty by the person\n> who\n> voluntarily took on the burden of caring for a child with very special needs.\n> What emerges from the allegations is an attitude\n> of hostility and intolerance\n> expressed as both physical and sexual abuse.”\n> \n\n\n1. As\nnoted in the Judgment, the evidence of Child 1’s teachers suggested a\ndegree of indifference or lack of empathy by the applicant\ntoward him.\n2. The\napplicant worked for almost 27 years with the DoE to support children with\nspecial needs. On her own evidence, she deeply understands\ndisability and the\nneeds of those affected by disability. We accept this as a truthful statement.\nShe has cared for a great many\nfoster children. She took in three siblings and\npossibly strove to maintain their connection with each other by continuing to\ncare\nfor them all despite not having strong positive emotions towards Child 1\nand, to a lesser extent, Child 2. She is now grieving for\n“her son”,\nthe youngest of the siblings who was removed when she was subject to the 2019\nCriminal Trial. The likely scenario\nthat developed over time is that she allowed\nherself to become depleted. She did not recognise that her relationship with\nChild 1\nhad become one in which any empathy she may have had for him in his very\nyoung years had dissipated to the point where she was emotionally\ndisconnected\nfrom him, and may have experienced disdain towards him.\n3. On\nbalance, based on the overwhelming material before us, it appears that the\napplicant felt resentment and hostility towards Child\n1, arising from his\nsoiling problem for at least 3 years which would have been a challenge on a\ndaily basis, and his overt sexualised\nbehaviours towards complete strangers. To\na lesser extent, it is apparent that she also harboured negative sentiments\ntowards Child\n2. In our view, whether intentional or inadvertent, her\ndifferential treatment of Child 1 and Child 2, compared with her close and\nprotective relationships with Child C and Child 3, was likely perceived by all\nchildren in the household. Child 1 and Child 2 were\nlikely to have felt isolated\nand excluded, suffering psychological and emotional harm.\n4. The\napplicant has not acknowledged this possibility, and has not shown insight into\nit or reflected upon it. There is no evidence\nbefore us that she has changed her\ncircumstances or engaged in therapeutic counselling to apply strategies to\nensure that, if she\nwas granted a clearance, a negative relationship dynamic\nwould not reoccur with any other child placed in her care.\n5. The\napplicant has expressed remorse over assaulting an adult in 2016. However, that\nremorse is expressed in self-serving terms, namely\nthat the applicant regrets\nshe was backed into a corner and forced to defend herself. The rationale behind\nher expression of regret\nappears to be that she had been forced to acknowledge\nthat she had been present at the time (because she *was* there and\n*did* slap the victim) and she therefore pleaded guilty.\n6. However,\nher approach to the allegations against her by Child 1 appears to be that since,\nin her mind, the allegations are false there\nis no cause for remorse. She has\nnot acknowledged the possibility that a child on the receiving end of such\nconduct would suffer\nharm. Without reflection on this, she cannot possibly\nacknowledge whether her conduct may have inadvertently caused harm. Without\nreflection and acknowledgment, it is not possible to mitigate against that\nconduct being repeated in the future. Repetition of the\nalleged conduct would\nplace any child exposed to the risk of severe and enduring\nharm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\n1. For\nthe reasons set out above, the Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence before it\nand on the balance of probabilities that the applicant\nposes a real and\nappreciable risk to the safety of children, and should not be granted a\nclearance.\n2. It\nis therefore not necessary to consider the reasonable person and public interest\ntests in ss 30(1A)(a) and 30(1A)(b) of the Act.\n\n**Orders**\n\n\n* (1) The decision\nof the Children’s Guardian dated 5 April 2022 to refuse to grant the\napplicant a working with children check\nclearance is\naffirmed.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\nI hereby certify that this is a true and accurate record of the reasons for\ndecision of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal of New\nSouth\nWales.  \n  \nRegistrar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The\nbasal facts are that the applicant, a female, and the respondent, a male, had a\npersonal relationship for many years. The respondent\nand his wife are the\nregistered proprietors of two parcels of land in southern New South Wales known\nas Burra and Burra Estate. Both\nparcels have the potential for subdivision. Up\nuntil 2006 when it burnt down, at all material times the applicant lived in Oak\nCottage,\nwhich was situated on Burra.\n3. The\napplicant says that she was promised by the respondent that, when Burra was\nsubdivided, she would be given Oak Cottage and its\ncurtilage. She was also told\nthat Oak Cottage was her home and there was no need for her to seek any divorce\nsettlement from her\nhusband.\n4. Because\nof the rather bizarre way in which this case proceeded below, no evidence was\never read to the Court before the applicant's\nclaim was struck out, but it seems\ncommon ground that there was a sexual relationship between the parties, that the\napplicant and\nher husband got divorced when that became known and that the\napplicant's then husband was the brother of the respondent's wife.\n5. The\napplicant said that she relied on the promises. She continued to live in Oak\nCottage. She did not seek any divorce settlement\nfrom her husband, the\ndefendant's brother-in-law, and she did considerable work on Oak Cottage. The\nrespondent says that the applicant\nwas only ever a tenant of Oak Cottage at a\nrent of usually $100 a week. The applicant agrees that she did for a period pay\n$100 a\nweek, but says that this was not really rent, this was a payment so that\nthe respondent's wife would think she was a tenant and not\nthere because of her\nrelationship with the respondent. What the truth is could only be resolved after\na full hearing which never\nhappened.\n6. The\napplicant's claim for equitable relief came before Gzell J on 7 March 2011.\nSomething odd then happened. The transcript shows\nthat, almost at the very\ncommencement of the hearing, the primary judge said to the applicant, who was\nthen appearing in person,\n\"Ms Van Dyke, will you tell me how you get around the\nproblem that there has been no subdivision of the Oaks Cottage land?\" The\napplicant\nresponded to that question and there was discussion.\n7. The\njudge seemed to have taken the view that the case was hopeless and that it would\nreally be criminal to spend too much time on\nthe matter. At page 5 of the\ntranscript, Mr C R C Newlinds SC, who appeared for the respondent, got hold of\nthose vibes and said,\n\"I don't require any evidence, and if your Honour requires\nit, I formally move that the plaintiff's case be dismissed.\"\n8. The\nprimary judge is then recorded as saying, \"I propose in that case to...\". The\napplicant interrupted him and asked for a chance\nto have her say. She asked\nwhether she could actually make her opening address. The primary judge agreed\nwith this. However, at the\nend of the address the primary judge said:\n\n\"Notwithstanding that opening, Ms Van Dyke, I remain of the view\nthat the action you have brought is fatally flawed. As I have said,\nI will give\nfull reasons for that judgment but I strike out the statement of claim and enter\njudgment for the defendant with costs.\"\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n1. The\nimpression one gets is that the \"motion\" to strike out was really the judge\nacting sua sponte and that Mr Newlinds just came on\nboard and made the formal\napplication.\n2. His\nHonour's reasons show that he dismissed the claim for two principal reasons.\nFirst, that the suit was defective for want of parties\nas the respondent's wife,\nwho was a joint tenant with him of Burra, was not a party to the proceedings yet\nan order was being sought\nwith respect to property of which she was a part\nowner. Second, that the promise made by the respondent was only to be fulfilled\nwhen Burra was subdivided and that had not yet occurred. The latter point was\nbased on a decision of this Court in *Public Trustee v Kukula*  [(1990) 14\nFam LR 97.](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2014%20Fam%20LR%2097 \"View LawCiteRecord\")\n3. At\nthis hearing, Mr D Ash appeared on a pro bono basis for the applicant and Mr C R\nCt Newlinds SC and Mr J Giles appeared for the\nrespondent. We did not call on Mr\nAsh, but his written submissions put that the primary judge should not have\nsummarily dismissed\nthe claim. He put that the primary judge appears to have\noverlooked the fact that the claim to Oak Cottage upon the subdivision of\nBurra\nwas only part of it and that, if one reads the statement of claim carefully,\nthere were at least two other aspects to the claim\nto Oak Cottage. One was that\nthe applicant was told that it would always be her home and, indeed, it was her\nhome. She was not told\nthat it would be at some time in the future, and, in\nactual fact, she was continuing to live there and, on her case, any money she\nwas paying was a pretend rent, not an actual rent as a tenant. Furthermore,\nthere was the fact that she could have obtained a divorce\nsettlement from her\nhusband, but she declined to do so on the basis of the promise that she would\nhave a house in which she would\nlive, namely, Oak Cottage.\n4. The\nrespondent puts that the claim was one solely based on promissory estoppel. Mr\nAsh says that, \"no\", the applicant's claim was\nalso based on unconscionable\nconduct and that if one looks at para 31 of the statement of claim one can see\nthat that was so. I think\nit is more likely than not what Mr Ash says here is\ncorrect. In any event, recent decisions in England such as *Gillett v Holt*[2000] EWCA 45; [2001] Ch 210 and *Jennings v Rice*  [[2002] EWCA Civ\n159](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/159.html \"View Case\"); [[2003] 1 P & CR 100](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20P%20%26%20CR%20100 \"View LawCiteRecord\") show that there is no definite boundary between\nunconscionable conduct and cases in promissory or proprietary estoppel.\n5. The\nplaintiff's case did have some problems. *Kukula* is a decision which is\nbinding on us, as it is a decision of this Court in 1990. However, cases such as\n*Gillett v Holt* and *Jennings v Rice* do show the limits of *Kukula*and perhaps it may even one day have to be reconsidered. Again, cases like\n*Morris v Morris* [1982]1 NSWLR 61 and the decision of Needham J in the\nLord Howe Island case **,** *Nichols v Nichols* (1986) 4 BPR 9240, show\nthat it is not necessarily a complete bar to a claim that there is some law\npreventing transfer of an interest\nin the subject property or some other party\nholds an interest in the property which is the subject of the claim: the Court\ncan give\nequitable compensation.\n6. Accordingly,\nit would seem to me that the learned judge did react too quickly to this case.\nHe should have considered the material\nand it would have been possible, despite\nthe defect which the judge thought to exist, for the plaintiff to have\nsucceeded. Accordingly,\nthis is a case where leave to appeal should be granted,\nthe appeal allowed and the matter sent back to the Equity Division to be\ntried\naccording to law.\n7. There\nare other peripheral matters which perhaps I should mention. There were other\ndefences to the claim which the trial judge specifically\nsaid he was not making\na decision about, he was dismissing the claim on the two points that I have\nmentioned. One of those is that\nthe promise was so uncertain that it could not\nbe enforced and that is a matter in the proposed notice of contention, but that\nmatter\ncan be dealt with on the re-trial, if necessary.\n8. The\nother matter that should be the subject of comment is the way in which the\nprimary judge disposed of this case. It is galling\nfor trial judges who perceive\nthat a case is probably hopeless to know that they might have to sit for a week\nand listen to a whole\nlot of material which in the end they consider is not\nnecessarily going to help them one bit. However, particularly where there is\na\nlitigant in person, as the plaintiff was, unfortunately it is usually their duty\nto hear people out at least to a certain extent,\nespecially where there is no\nactual motion for the striking out of the claim and everyone has prepared for a\ntrial with copious affidavits\nand is ready to run the trial.\n9. At\nthe very least, with respect to his Honour, I would have thought it would have\nbeen good practice and a practice that should almost\ninvariably be followed that\nhe not only should have heard the opening address, he should have heard the\naffidavits on both sides\nformally read. So far as the lack of parties point is\nconcerned, before doing anything it may be that the primary judge should have\ngiven the opportunity of the litigant in person to consult a lawyer to see\nwhether she wished to amend the suit.\n10. Now,\nMr Ash does in his submissions claim a denial of natural justice. I do not think\nI need go any further than what I have just\nsaid.\n11. It\nfollows that I would propose that leave to appeal be granted, that the draft\nnotice of appeal behind tab 4 of the white book should\nbe treated as a notice of\nappeal, allow the appeal, remit the case for trial in the Equity Division by a\njudge other than Gzell J\nand order that the respondent, if eligible, have a\ncertificate under the *[Suitors' Fund Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/)* 1951 but the respondent is to pay\nthe costs of the appeal.\n12. **BATHURST\nCJ:** I agree with the reasons of Young JA and the orders which he proposes.\n13. **HODGSON\nJA:** I also agree.\n14. **YOUNG\nJA:** I should have also added that the orders made by Gzell J are accordingly\nset aside.\n\nNEWLINDS: I wonder, there's the question of the costs below of the\ntrial. Now, appreciating Ms Van Dyke was then representing herself.\nI don't know\nif the rules provide that if the appeal is allowed the costs below are\nautomatically reversed? \n\n\n  \n  \n\nYOUNG JA: They don't. \n\n\n  \n  \n\nNEWLINDS: In my submission the costs of what happened ought properly be costs\nin the cause. \n\n\n  \n  \n\nHODGSON JA: I think the usual order would be that they're in the discretion\nof the judge who hears the case. \n\n\n  \n  \n\nNEWLINDS: I wouldn't be heard against that. \n\n\n  \n  \n\n1. **YOUNG\nJA:** Costs in the first trial to be subject to the order of the judge who\nconducts the second trial.\n2. **BATHURST\nCJ:** I agree.\n3. **HODGSON\nJA:** Yes, I agree.\n4. **BATHURST\nCJ:** The orders of the Court will be as pronounced by Young JA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n"}

GILES\nJA: This is an appeal by the defendant from summary judgment for $73,408 plus\ninterest ordered against him in the District Court.\nLeave to appeal was granted\non 27 May 2011.\n\n\n1. The\ndefendant was the owner of an aircraft VH-ZNZ. On 5 April 2006, VH-ZNZ crashed\nat Bankstown Airport, when being piloted by Mr\nRonald Bertram on a test flight\nafter repairs. Mr Bertram was killed. Part of the aircraft hit another aircraft\nowned by the plaintiff,\nVH-MPC, standing on the ground at the airport, and\ndamaged VH-MPC.\n\n\n1. Both\nowners invoked their insurance. The plaintiff's insurer, a QBE company,\nindemnified the plaintiff and in the exercise of it subrogation\nrights made a\nclaim upon the defendant which was dealt with by his insurer, Hemisphere. After\na lengthy period of negotiation, an\nagreement was reached between the loss\nadjustors for each insurer. Two documents dated 26 September 2007 were signed on\nbehalf of\nthe plaintiff, one dealing with loss of use of VH-MPC and the other\ndealing with the damage to it.\n\n\n1. The\nlatter document was in the terms -\n\n\n\" **PARTIAL RELEASE** \n\n\n\nIN CONSIDERATION of the payments of SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND\nEIGHT DOLLARS (the agreed sum) to GENERAL FLYING SERVICES\nPTY LTD - ABN 24 004\n716 929 - (\"the claimant\") of Moorabbin Airport Victoria by and on behalf of\nChristopher John HERDE of Berrima,\nNSW (\"the owner\") the claimant hereby accepts\nthe agreed sum in full and final settlement and satisfaction of its claim (other\nthan\nfor loss of use) and release and discharges the owner, his Insurer and the\nEstate of Ronald Bertram from any and all claims, actions,\nsuits or demands of\nwhatsoever nature that the claimant may have, would or might have had for the\ncost of repairs to Piper Seminole\naircraft Regn VH-MPC the property of the\nclaimant as a result of the impact by Lancair aircraft VH-ZNZ on 5 April 2006 at\nBankstown\nAirport NSW (\"the incident\"). \n\n\n\nThe claimant reserves its rights in all respects with regard to a claim for\nloss of use. \n\n\n\nThe agreed sum is being paid without admission of liability and the terms of\nthis settlement are to remain confidential. \n\n\n\nThe claimant irrevocably directs that the agreed sum be paid as follows: \n\n\n\na) QBE Insurance (Australia) Limited $73408.00 \n\n\nb) The claimant $2500.00 \n\n\n\nand receipt by them of the specified amounts constitutes a full discharge of\nthe owners obligation for payment of the agreed sum under\nthe terms of this\nRelease. \n\n\n\nThe person signing this Release warrants that he is authorised to sign for\nand on behalf of the claimant.\" \n\n\n\n1. I\nwill refer to this as \"the release.\" The $2,500 appears to have been an excess\npayable by the plaintiff under its insurance.\n\n\n1. The\nsum of money payable under the first document was paid, as was the $2,500 the\nsubject of the release. The $73,408 was not. There\nis no evidence, but we were\ntold that Hemisphere was not in a position to pay it.\n\n\n1. The\nplaintiff, in reality the QBE company exercising its subrogated rights, looked\nto the defendant. It brought proceedings in the\nDistrict Court in which it\nclaimed $73,408, first as damages pursuant to the defendant's liability under\nthe *Damage by Aircraft Act* 1999 (C'th), and secondly on an agreement\nfound in a number of documents but essentially in the release. As to the\ncontractual claim,\nthe defendant filed an uninformative defence saying that he\n\"did not agree to anything with the Plaintiff in relation to the Plaintiff's\nalleged claim.\"\n\n\n1. The\ndefendant did not dispute that, on the wording of the release, it would\nconstitute an agreement to which he was a party under\nwhich $73,408 was payable\nto the plaintiff (more specifically, to the QBE company at the plaintiff's\ndirection). At least as clarified\non appeal, the sole issue before the judge had\nbeen and the sole issue on appeal was whether the defendant's insurer had\nauthority\nto enter into the release on his behalf.\n\n\n1. The\njudge correctly directed himself that summary judgment should be granted only\nwhere the defence was so obviously untenable that\nit could not possibly succeed\nor was manifestly groundless. His Honour found that \"there is no triable issue,\"\nstating that the evidence\n\"is really clear cut\" and \"is compelling.\"\nUnfortunately, his Honour did not identify the evidence of which he took this\nview.\n\n\n1. Before\nthe judge the defendant's policy was not in evidence. The plaintiff had required\nits production under a notice to produce,\nbut there was objection to production\non procedural grounds and the objection was upheld. The documentary evidence\nbefore his Honour\ndid not permit a finding to the requisite satisfaction that\nthe insurer had been authorised to enter into the release. Any inference\navailable from the negotiation and signature of the release was insufficient.\nThe policy was not in evidence. Other material on which\nthe judge could have\ncome to his conclusion could be found in admissions and statements made by the\nsolicitor appearing for the defendant.\nThe height to which that came was that\npursuant to the defendant's insurance, the insurer would indemnify him in\nrespect of any claims\nfor damages arising from the use or operation of his\naircraft; that the insurer had a right under its policy to enter into\nnegotiations\nto settle the claim; and that the negotiations which there was no\nreason to dispute took place were between agents or agents and\nemployees of the\nrespective insurers. That, however, fell short of authority from the defendant\nto settle the claim against him by\nentry into the release. Summary judgment\nshould not have been granted.\n\n\n1. Counsel\nfor the parties recognised the need to address the real dispute. The policy was\na key matter in whether the release was entered\ninto with the defendant's\nauthority. Counsel commendably obtained instructions whereby the plaintiff made\nan oral application for\nrevocation of the grant of leave to appeal, the policy\nwas tendered in that application, and submissions were presented going to\nwhether the policy was a source of authority. If it obviously was, the result to\nwhich the judge came was correct. It would then\nbe open to revoke the grant of\nleave to appeal and, the real dispute having been identified and dealt with, the\nparties would be\nsaved further litigation and expense.\n\n\n1. The\npolicy as tendered did not include the schedule, but it was agreed that it\ncontained the wording for the insurance responding\nto the plaintiff's claim.\nClause 5 in Section XI provided -\n\n\n\"5. The company shall be entitled (if they so elect) at any time and for so\nlong as they desire to take absolute control of all negotiations\nand proceedings\nand in the name of the Insured to settle, defend or pursue any claim.\" \n\n\n\n1. The\nplaintiff relied on this clause, which in its terms gave Hemisphere authority to\nenter into the release on the defendant's behalf:\nsee *Beacon Insurance\nCompany Ltd v Langdale*  [(1939) 4 All ER 204.](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%204%20All%20ER%20204 \"View LawCiteRecord\") The defendant submitted,\nhowever, that there was a further question of the application of the clause to\nthe settlement recorded in\nthe release. He relied upon *Groom v Crocker* [(1939) 1 KB 194.](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%201%20KB%20194 \"View LawCiteRecord\")\n\n\n1. In\nthat case the policy provided that the insurer should \"have absolute conduct and\ncontrol of all or any proceedings against the\ninsured.\" The insurer admitted\nliability in negligence on behalf of the insured, although knowing that he had\nnot been negligent.\nSir Wilfrid Greene MR said at 203 -\n\n\n\"The question therefore is, Was the admission of negligence on which in the\ncircumstances the insurers were entitled under the policy\nto require the assured\nto make? In my opinion clearly not. The right given to the insurers is to have\ncontrol of proceedings in which\nthey and the assured have a common interest -\nthe assured because he is the defendant and the insurers because they are\ncontractually\nbound to indemnify him. Each is interested in seeing that any\njudgment to be recovered against the assured shall be for as small\na sum as\npossible. It is the assured upon whom the burden of the judgment will fall if\nthe insurers are insolvent. The effect of\nthe provisions in question is, I\nthink, to give to the insurers the right to decide upon the proper tactics to\npursue in the conduct\nof the action, provided that they do so in what they bona\nfide consider to be the common interest of themselves and their assured.\nBut the\ninsurers are in my opinion clearly not entitled to allow their judgment as to\nthe best tactics to pursue to be influenced\nby the desire to obtain for\nthemselves some advantage altogether outside the litigation in question with\nwhich the assured has no\nconcern. This is what was done in the present case.\"\n\n\n\n\n1. The\ndefendant submitted that the present case was arguably analogous. Under the\nrelease he, the defendant, would have to pay the $73,408;\nhe alone would have to\npay that sum. He would obtain a release, but so also would the estate of Mr\nBertram. The estate would pay\nnothing. If Mr Bertram as pilot had been liable\nand had been covered under the same policy, the estate was benefited at the\ndefendant's\nexpense. If Mr Bertram as pilot had not been covered under the same\npolicy, the misuse of the authority under cl 5, it was submitted,\nwas all the\ngreater.\n\n\n1. The\ndefendant said that it was material to whether there had been this misuse of the\nauthority under cl 5 to investigate whether he\nor Mr Bertram had both incurred\nliability for, or their respective responsibilities for, the damage suffered by\nthe plaintiff. While\nunder the Commonwealth *Damage by Aircraft Act* they\nmight have incurred equal liability, that depended on whether Bankstown Airport\nwas Commonwealth territory. It was by no means\nclear that they would have\nincurred equal liability if it was not Commonwealth territory and the *Damage\nby Aircraft Act* 1952 (NSW) applied. There was no evidence that the airport\nwas Commonwealth territory, which required investigation, and if it was\nnot\nthere were further issues to be raised pursuant to s 2(3) of the State act\nconcerning whether the aircraft had been \"bona fide\ndemised, let or hired out\"\nby the defendant.\n\n\n1. In\nmy opinion, it cannot be said that this response by the defendant is unarguable.\nIt raises issues which in my view should be permitted\nto go to trial.\nAccordingly, it seems to me that it cannot be said that cl 5 is so obvious a\nsource of authority that the judge came\nto the correct result, whereby that the\ngrant of leave to appeal should be revoked.\n\n\n1. Returning\nthen to the judgment below, his Honour was in error because summary judgment\nshould not have been granted. It follows that\norders should be made whereby the\noral application to revoke the leave to appeal should be dismissed and the\nappeal should be allowed.\nOrders 1 and 2 made by the judge on 22 October 2010\nshould be set aside, and in lieu thereof it should be ordered that the\nplaintiff's\nnotice of motion be dismissed.\n\n\n1. The\njudge made an order as to costs in order 4. However, the question of costs is\nsomething on which we should hear the parties.\n\n\n1. MACFARLAN\nJA: I agree.\n\n\n1. MEAGHER\nJA: I agree with Giles JA.\n\n\n[Counsel addressed on costs] \n\n\n\n1.

The\napplicant, BMG, is a “disqualified” person under subs 18(1) of the\n*Child Protection (Working with Children) Act 2012* (the Act) and seeks an\n“enabling order” pursuant to s 28 of that Act, declaring that he not\nbe treated as a “disqualified”\nperson so that he can be granted a\nclearance to work with children.\n2. Due\nto the sensitive nature of these proceedings, an order was made, under\nsubsection 64(1)(a) of the *Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013,*\nprohibiting the publication and broadcasting of the name of the applicant, the\nname of any victim or child referred to in the material\nbefore the Tribunal and\nthe name of any other person that might identify the name of the applicant or\nthe name of a victim or child\nwithout the leave of the Tribunal. For this\npurpose the pseudonym BMG has been used for the applicant’s name.\n3. The\napplicant is a “disqualified person” by reason of his conviction, in\nDecember 1999, for the offence of manslaughter\ncontrary to [s 18(1)(b)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s18.html) of the\n*[Crimes Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/)* 1900. The offending conduct occurred in May 1998. The victim\nof the offending conduct was the applicant’s girlfriend, who was 16\nyears\nof age at the time. The offence is an offence falling within cl 1(b) of schedule\n2 of the Act.\n4. The\nCourt sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for seven and a half years, with a\nminimum term of four and a half years. His sentence\ncommenced from the date of\nthe offence and he was released on parole in November 2002. The applicant has\nnot been convicted or charged\nwith any other offence.\n5. On\n1 August 2014, the respondent refused the applicant’s application for a\nclearance under the Act. As the offence of which\nthe applicant was convicted was\na disqualifying offence under cl 1 of schedule 2 of the Act, the respondent was\nrequired to refuse\nthe application: the Act, subs 18(1).\n6. Subsection\n28(1) of the Act gave the applicant a right to seek an enabling order following\nthe respondent’s refusal. That application\nwas made within the prescribed\ntime and there is no dispute the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine\nthis application.\nThe applicant seeks an enabling order so that he can continue\nto coach BMX riders.\n7. By\nreasons of subsection 28(7) of the Act the applicant is presumed to pose a risk\nto the safety of children unless he proves to the\ncontrary.\n8. The\njurisdiction of the Tribunal is protective and not punitive in nature; see\n*Commissioner for Children and Young People v FZ* [[2011] NSWCA 11](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2011/11.html \"View Case\") per Young\nJA at [61]. That is, the object of the Act is not to impose additional\npunishment on a disqualified person but to eliminate\npossible risks to the\nsafety of children by persons working in child-related\nwork\n\n**Proceedings before the Tribunal**\n\n\n1. The\napplicant’s application for an enabling order and a stay came before me,\non 30 September 2014. I refused the applicant’s\napplication for a stay and\nmade directions for the filing and serving of material by the applicant and the\nrespondent. By consent,\nI also set the matter down for hearing on 21 November\n2014.\n2. The\napplicant’s application was heard before Senior Member Andrews on 21\nNovember 2014. By consent, the hearing was adjourned\nfor a further half day\nhearing, on 10 December 2014. Due to the unavailability of the Senior Member on\nthis day, the hearing was\nfurther adjourned to 22 January 2015.\n3. At\nthe conclusion of the hearing on 22 January 2015, Senior Member Andrews reserved\nher decision.\n4. Subsequently,\nand prior to a determination of the application, Senior Member Andrews became\nunavailable and not able to complete the\ndecision. On 26 March 2015, the\nPresident wrote to the parties to inform them of Senior Member Andrew’s\nunavailability and\nthat he proposed that I be appointed to replace her, under s\n52 of the *Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act* 2013. The parties were\nalso invited to make any submissions on the proposed reconstitution. Section 52\nof the *Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013* relevantly\nprovides:\n\n\n> \n> 52 Reconstitution of Tribunal during proceedings  \n>   \n> \n> (1) The President may replace the member, or one of the members, constituting\n> the Tribunal after the consideration of a matter by\n> the Tribunal has commenced\n> if, before the matter is determined, the member:\n\n\n\n> \n> > (a) becomes unavailable for any reason, or  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (b) ...\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> (2) The President may not replace a member unless the President has\n> first:\n\n\n\n> \n> > (a) afforded the parties an opportunity to make\n> > submissions about the proposed replacement, and  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (b) taken any such submissions into account.\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> \n> (3) The Tribunal as so reconstituted is to have regard to the evidence,\n> submissions and decisions in relation to the matter that\n> were given or made\n> before the Tribunal was reconstituted.\n\n1. No\nsubmissions were received and on 13 April 2015, the Tribunal President replaced\nSenior Member Andrews as proposed.\n2. In\ndetermining this application I have read and considered the material filed by\nthe parties. I have also listened to the sound recordings\nof the hearing on 21\nNovember 2014 and 22 January 2015.\n3. The\napplicant, I note, has not been legally represented during the course of the\nhearing. The respondent, on the other hand has been\nrepresented by counsel.\n4. For\nthe reasons set out below, on balance, I am not satisfied the applicant has\ndischarged his onus in rebutting the presumption that\nhe poses a risk to the\nsafety of children. It is now 17 years since the applicant was convicted of the\ndisqualifying offence and\nthere are many factors in his favour which are\nprotective against the risk of any further offending. I have found that his\nlikelihood\nof re-offending is low. However, I have some reservation about the\napplicant having a propensity to over-react towards those whom\nhe does not\ntrust, or is fearful of. That propensity, in my view, may have a bearing on the\napplicant’s previously identified\ndifficulties in emotional attachments\nand depressive mood. That propensity may not be substantial, but in the absence\nof an independent\nforensic psychological risk assessment (i.e. an assessment by\na suitably qualified professional who has not treated the applicant\nand who has\nbeen provided all the material filed in this application) that addresses this\nquestion I am unable to find that the applicant\nhas discharged his onus. It may\nof course be an assessment the applicant is able to obtain.\n\n**The\nevidence**\n\n\n1. In\nsupport of his application, the applicant relied on an affidavit he swore on 15\nOctober 2014. Exhibited to that affidavit were\na number of documents\nincluding:\n\t* the transcript\n\tof the Trial Judge’s summing up to the jury in December 1999,\n\t* a copy of the\n\tapplicant’s marriage certificate (2007),\n\t* a copy of the\n\tapplicant’s University Bachelor degree, dated December 2005, together with\n\this academic transcript for the years\n\t2003 and 2004,\n\t* a copy of a\n\treference from the National Coaching Director of BMX Australia, dated July\n\t2014;\n\t* an affidavit of\n\ta friend and Director of BMX Australia sworn on 15 October 2014;\n\t* a copy of a\n\treference from the Chief Executive Officer of the applicant’s local\n\tAcademy of Sport, dated June 2014,\n\t* copies of the\n\tapplicant’s certificates, in 2005 and 2006, as the BMX Coach of the\n\tYear;\n\t* a copy of a\n\tletter, dated June 2009, from NSW Sport and Recreation to the applicant in\n\tregard to his working with children check for\n\tthe position of BMX coach with BMX\n\tNSW. The letter advised that it had been estimated there were significant risks\n\trelating to his\n\tpersonal history;\n\t* a copy of a\n\tletter, dated March 2010, from Cycling Australia to the applicant concerning his\n\tcoach re-accreditation. The letter advised\n\tthat due to his background check, and\n\tin accordance with the relevant accreditation scheme requirements the applicant\n\twas re-accredited\n\tas a BMX coach on the grounds that he only coach riders 18\n\tyears and over;\n\t* a report, dated\n\t10 July 2014, from Dr Maryann Gauci, a clinical psychologist who assessed the\n\tapplicant on 14 November 2013;\n2. The\napplicant also gave oral evidence at the hearing and was cross-examined by\ncounsel for the respondent. Dr Gauci gave oral evidence,\nby telephone, at the\nhearing on 22 January 2015.\n3. The\nrespondent placed before the Tribunal five bundles of documents obtained in the\ncourse of enquiries by the office of the respondent\nand in response to\nsummonses, issued by the Tribunal, at the request of the respondent. These\nbundles were as follows:\n\t* Volume 1 –\n\tcontains a copy of the applicant’s CRIMTRAC record, the police fact sheet\n\tin regard to the applicant’s\n\tdisqualifying offence, the sentencing remarks\n\tof the trial Judge, AVO information from NSW Police, documents produced under\n\tsummons\n\tfrom BMX Australia and other relevant BMX organisations and the s31\n\tresponses from the Department of Corrective Services;\n\t* Volume 2, 3 and\n\t4 – contains further responses from the Department of Corrective\n\tServices;\n\t* Volume 5 –\n\tcontains the s31 response from the Department of Sport & Recreation and\n\tfurther correspondence between the respondent\n\tand the applicant in November\n\t2014, prior to the first day of hearing. The response from the Department of\n\tSport & Recreation\n\tcontains a further copy of the Police Fact sheet and the\n\ttrial Judge’s remarks on sentence in regard to the disqualifying\n\toffence;\n4. To\nthe extent relevant in this application, I have dealt with the information\ncontained in the above documents in more detail below.\n\n**The\nrelevant provisions of Child Protection (Working with Children) Act** \n\n\n1. The\nobjects of the Act are:\n\n\n> \n> **“3 Object of Act**  \n>   \n> \n> The object of this Act is to protect children:\n\n\n\n> \n> > (a) by not permitting certain persons to engage in\n> > child-related work, and  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (b) by requiring persons engaged in child-related work to have working with\n> > children check clearances.”\n> \n> \n\n\n1. Section\n4 of the Act provides that the “safety, welfare and well-being of children\nand, in particular, protecting them from\nchild abuse, is the paramount\nconsideration” in the operation of the Act. That is, when making decisions\nunder the Act paramount\nconsideration is to be given to the safety, welfare and\nwell-being of children and, in particular, protecting them from child\nabuse.\n2. The\nword “children” is defined in subsection 5(1) to mean persons under\nthe age of 18 years. Consequently, the word ‘child’\nhas the same\nmeaning.\n3. Subsection\n8(1) of the Act prohibits a person from engaging in “child-related\nwork”, unless: (a) the person holds the\nrelevant working with children\ncheck clearance, or (b) there is a current application, by the person, to the\nrespondent for the relevant\nworking with children check clearance. This\nprohibition is an offence, carrying a maximum penalty of 100 penalty units, or\nimprisonment\nfor two years, or both.\n4. Subsection\n9(1) contains a similar prohibition on an employer, employing or continuing to\nemploy a person in “child related\nwork” where the employer knows or\nhas reasonable cause to believe that the person is not the holder of a relevant\nworking with\nchildren check clearance, or there is no current application by the\nperson for such a clearance.\n5. The\nterm “child-relate work” is defined in section 6 of the Act. The\napplicant states he is seeking a working with children\ncheck so that he can\nagain be involved in part-time BMX sports coaching. There is no dispute that\napplicant requires a working with\nchildren check clearance to undertake this\nwork, even on a voluntary basis. However, the Tribunal is required to consider\nhis application\nin the context of the very broad characterisation of\nchild-related work in s 6 of the Act: *BKE v Children’s Guardian* [[2015] NSWSC 523](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2015/523.html \"View Case\"), at [27].\n6. As\nnoted above, subsection 18(1) of the Act provides that the respondent must\nrefuse an application for a clearance where the applicant\nis a disqualified\nperson by reason of having been convicted of an offence falling within schedule\n2 of the Act.\n7. Section\n22 of the Act provides that a working with children check clearance check ceases\nto have effect five years after it was granted,\nunless it is cancelled or\nsuspended prior to that time: see the Act, ss 23 and 24.\n8. Again,\nas noted above, subsection 28(1) of the Act makes provision for a\n“disqualified person” to make an application\nto the Tribunal for an\nenabling order.\n9. Where\nan application is made under subsection 28(1), that section also provides as\nfollows:\n\n**“28 Orders relating to disqualified and ineligible\npersons**\n\n\n(1) ...\n\n\n...\n\n\n(4) The Children’s Guardian is to be a party to any proceedings for an\norder under this section and may make submissions in\nopposition to or support of\nthe making of the order.\n\n\n(5) An applicant must fully disclose to the Tribunal any matters relevant to\nthe application.\n\n\n(6) If the Tribunal makes an enabling order, the Tribunal may order the\nChildren’s Guardian to ... grant the person a clearance.\n\n\n(7) In any proceedings where an enabling order is sought, it is to be\npresumed, unless the applicant proves to the contrary, that\nthe applicant poses\na risk to the safety of children.\n\n\n(8) An enabling order may not be made subject to conditions.\n\n\n(9) ...”\n\n\n1. The\nmeaning of the word “risk” was considered by his Honour Young CJ in\nEq, in *Commission for Children and Young People v V*  [[2002] NSWSC\n949.](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/949.html \"View Case\") At [[42]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/949.html#para42), His Honour made the following remarks in regard to the word\n“risk” as it appeared in the former *[Child Protection (Prohibited\nEmployment) Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cpea1998401/)*1998:\n\n\n> \n> “What one is looking for is whether, in all the circumstances, there is a\n> real and appreciable risk in the sense of a risk\n> that is greater than the risk\n> of any adult preying on a child. One, however, must link the word \"risk\" with\n> the words that follow,\n> namely, \"to the safety of\n> children.\"”\n\n1. These\nremarks have been accepted to equally apply to the word “risk” as it\nappears in the current Act: see *AYU v NSW Office of the Children’s\nGuardian*  [[2014] NSWCATAD 69](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/69.html \"View Case\"), at [39] and *BKE v Office of the NSW\nChildren’s Guardian*  [[2015] NSWSC 523](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2015/523.html \"View Case\") (*BKE*), at [26].\n2. Section\n30 sets out the matters the Tribunal is required to consider in determining an\napplication for an enabling order. That section\nis in the following\nterms:\n\n\n> \n> **“30 Determination of applications and other matters**  \n>   \n> \n> (1) The Tribunal must consider the following in determining an application under\n> this Part:\n\n\n\n> \n> > (a) the seriousness of the offences with respect to\n> > which the person is a disqualified person or any matters that caused a refusal\n> > of a clearance or imposition of an interim bar,  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (b) the period of time since those offences or matters occurred and the conduct\n> > of the person since they occurred,  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (c) the age of the person at the time the offences or matters occurred,  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (d) the age of each victim of any relevant offence or conduct at the time they\n> > occurred and any matters relating to the vulnerability\n> > of the victim,  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (e) the difference in age between the victim and the person and the relationship\n> > (if any) between the victim and the person,  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (f) whether the person knew, or could reasonably have known, that the victim was\n> > a child,  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (g) the person’s present age,  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (h) the seriousness of the person’s total criminal record and the conduct\n> > of the person since the offences occurred,  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (i) the likelihood of any repetition by the person of the offences or conduct\n> > and the impact on children of any such repetition,  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (j) any information given by the applicant in, or in relation to, the\n> > application,  \n> >   \n> > \n> > (k) any other matters that the Children’s Guardian considers\n> > necessary.”\n> \n> \n\n\n**Consideration and findings in regard to the subs 30(1) factors**\n\n\n*S 30(1)(a) the seriousness of the offence with respect to which the\napplicant is a disqualified person*\n\n\n1. The\noffence with respect to which the applicant is a disqualified person is clearly\na very serious offence. The applicant does not\ncontend otherwise.\n2. The\napplicant had been indicted on the offence of murder before the Supreme Court.\nHe pleaded not guilty and gave evidence in the\ncourse of his trial. Following a\nsix day trial hearing the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder but\nguilty of manslaughter.\nThe maximum penalty for an offence of manslaughter is 25\nyears imprisonment. The remarks of the Trial Judge in sentencing the applicant\nis a reflection of the seriousness of the applicant’s conduct.\n3. The\nvictim was a child and the applicant’s girlfriend. They had been in a\nrelationship for about 11 months and shared an interest\nin BMX riding.\n4. In\nhis sentencing remarks, the Trial Judge dealt with the evidence that was before\nthe Court and he made certain findings of fact\nfrom the evidence in light of the\nJury’s finding of guilt of manslaughter. His Honour explained that the\nrelationship between\nthe applicant and the victim as intimate, passionate and\nvirtually exclusive, but some weeks before her death the victim had expressed\nto\nfamily and friends some reservations as to whether the relationship should\ncontinue on that basis. However, she had not expressed\nthose reservations to the\napplicant until some four days prior to her death.\n5. The\nvictim was admitted into hospital three days before her death because of a\nrecurrent back injury. The applicant visited her the\nnext day, the following day\nand then again on the morning of her death. In the course of those visits the\nvictim made known to him\nher intention to break off their relationship. The\napplicant became very distressed and others had seen him to be in tears. On the\nday before her death, the applicant had told the victim that if she persisted\nwith her intention he would take his own life. He repeated\nthat threat on the\nfollowing morning. Early in the afternoon of the day of her death, the applicant\nreturned to the hospital. He\ntook with him a loaded .22 rifle concealed under a\nlong top coat.\n6. The\nTrial Judge set out in some detail the evidence that was before the Court,\nincluding the evidence of the applicant. At [59] of\nhis sentencing remarks, the\nTrial Judge said that the only conclusion open, on the evidence before the\nCourt, as to the applicant’s\nguilt and on which he should be sentenced,\nwere as follows:\n\n\n> \n> “I find that the prisoner entered the hospital ward with the loaded\n> firearm, with no intention of killing or harming [the victim],\n> indeed with no\n> intention other than that of taking his own life and that the actual discharge\n> of the weapon at the moment when it\n> did discharge was not a voluntary action on\n> his part. Nevertheless there can be no doubt that the whole of his obviously\n> voluntary\n> conduct in taking the weapon into the hospital, loaded and cocked, and\n> manipulating the weapon in his attempts to cause it to discharge\n> in pursuit of\n> his intention to take his own life was unlawful and constituted a dangerous act\n> in the sense that it exposed [the victim]\n> to a significant risk of serious\n> injury, of which risk a reasonable person in the position of the accused would\n> have been well aware.\n> His conduct in taking the loaded cocked weapon into the\n> hospital ward with the intention of discharging it there for whatever reason,\n> was clearly not only unlawful but dangerous in the sense in which the law\n> defines that phrase; and directly resulted in her death.”\n\n1. At\n[67], the Trial Judge referred to the report of Dr John Ellard, described as one\nof the country’s foremost psychiatrists,\nwho had seen the applicant in\nprison after he was found guilty of manslaughter and prior to his sentence\nhearing. In his report Dr\nEllard said that “for a normal and emotional\ndevelopment one needs secure attachments to the important figures in one’s\nearly life.” He went on to say, that although the applicant sought them,\nthe circumstances were such that there was little\nconsistency in his early years\n- he was looked after but there were manifest difficulties. His Honour accepted\nthe applicant’s\nrelationship with the victim was his first serious\nrelationship. His Honour also accepted the following analysis of Dr\nEllard:\n\n\n> \n> “I believe that he [the applicant] wanted a secure relationship very much\n> and that this relationship with the deceased [the\n> victim] was very important to\n> him, satisfying a long-felt need. It may well be that he overvalued it –\n> this is not uncommon.\n> It lasted some 11 months and then she told him that it was\n> ended. He became depressed and decided to end his life in a way which\n> would\n> bring home to her what he felt she had done to him.”\n\n1. At\n[69], His Honour, the Trial Judge said:\n\n\n> \n> “Clearly, this is not a case where one can postulate “the absence of\n> facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime”.\n> Clearly it is not in the\n> worst case category and the Crown Prosecutor did not seek to persuade me\n> otherwise.  \n>   \n> \n> On the contrary, although the physical acts of the prisoner amounted to unlawful\n> and dangerous conduct of a very serious kind, the\n> level of his criminality was\n> obviously greatly diminished by his emotional state at the time.  \n>   \n> \n> Evidence was adduced at the trial, which satisfies me that the accused is a\n> young man of previous good character, indeed a young\n> man who appeared prior to\n> his commission of this offence to be a very worthwhile member of the community\n> with the potential to make\n> a very great contribution to the community as he\n> developed. In particular, it is to be noted that he has no prior criminal\n> convictions.\n> I accept the whole of that evidence, for there is nothing in the\n> circumstances of this tragic case to cast any doubt on the validity\n> of the\n> opinions expressed by those who have known him.”\n\n1. In\nhis affidavit, filed in these proceedings, the applicant said he did not want to\nplay down the enormity of what he had done. He\nacknowledged that he had taken\nsomeone else’s life away from them. He said the charge of which he was\nconvicted was involuntary\nmanslaughter and that he had to live with the\nconsequences of his dreadful actions of that day which led to the death of\nanother\nhuman being – his ex-girlfriend and a person whom he loved very\nmuch. He said that while he deeply regretted what he did, he\ndid not\nintentionally perpetrate an offence against a child. He reiterated he did not\nwant to play down or shirk responsibility for\nwhat he had done, but the\ncircumstances surrounding the case were a tragic accident, not a planned or\npre-meditated action.\n2. In\ncross-examination, the applicant readily acknowledged that he intentionally went\ninto the hospital, with the firearm and with the\nintent to use it on himself, in\nfront of the victim. He was asked why did he want to do this? The applicant\nresponded that at the\ntime he wanted to show the victim how much he loved her.\nHe said he now recognises that this would be a dreadful thing to do as it\nwould\nhave left the victim severely traumatised. He said his only explanation for\ndoing what he did was despair over the break-up\nand suicidal thoughts, which he\nhad experienced previously. The applicant said he did not want to punish or harm\nthe victim.\n3. I\naccept the applicant is extremely remorseful for what he did. At no time did he\nintend to kill the victim, but understands that\nhis conduct resulted in her\ndeath. That is, the applicant, in my view fully appreciates the seriousness of\nhis offending conduct\nand will do so for the rest of his life.\n4. It\nwas put to the applicant that he had no empathy towards the victim’s\nfamily in light of his challenge to the compensation\nawards that were made in\ntheir favour. In my view, the alleged challenge is not reflective of a lack of\nempathy. As the applicant\nexplained, he supported the awards of compensation\nthat were made to the family under the *Victims Compensation Act*. He\nchallenged, on legal advice, the amount of restitution he was required to pay\nand it was not a challenge to the amounts that\nhad been awarded to the\nfamily.\n5. The\nrespondent contends that the applicant has failed to appropriately, if at all,\naddress his offending conduct as he refused to\nundergo any psychological therapy\nwhile in prison or thereafter. I have dealt with this issue in more detail under\nthe heading “*S30(1)(i) the likelihood of any repetition\n...*”\n6. In\nconclusion, I agree with the findings of the Trial Judge that while the\napplicant’s offending was a “tragic case”,\nit was nevertheless\nserious, but not in the “worst case category”. The applicant does\nnot argue otherwise and continues\nto express genuine remorse.\n\n*S\n30(1)(b) the period of time since the disqualifying offences and the conduct of\nthe applicant since they occurred*\n\n\n1. It\nis 17 years since the occurrence of the conduct the subject of the\napplicant’s disqualifying offence. He was imprisoned until\n2002 and then\non parole from 2002 to 2005.\n2. The\napplicant worked whenever he could during his time in prison and also while on\nparole. He retrained while in prison and while\non parole. He commenced a\nUniversity undergraduate degree in 2001. He completed this degree in 2005 and is\ncontinuing to do post\ngraduate studies.\n3. While\nat University, studying for his undergraduate degree he met his wife. They\nmarried in 2007 and travelled around Australia for\ntwo years. He worked while he\nwas travelling and has continued to be employed since that time. In 2013, the\napplicant’s wife\ngave birth to their son.\n4. On\nhis release from prison, the applicant re-commenced coaching BMX racing on a\nvoluntary part time basis. He was named the Australian\nCoach of the Year, by BMX\nAustralia, in 2006 and was also named the State Coach of the Year, by BMX NSW,\nin 2005, 2006 and 2008.\n5. In\n2010 the applicant was briefly banned from coaching children, by reason of his\ndisqualifying offence. He was later approved to\ncoach children under specific\nconditions which included a requirement that during his coaching sessions he\nwould be accompanied by\nan accredited Level 7 official or Level 1 accredited\ncoach. The applicant ceased all coaching of children after he was refused his\nworking with children check clearance.\n\n*S30(1)(c) the age of the\napplicant at the time the disqualifying offences occurred*\n\n\n1. The\napplicant was 20 years and 7 months of age at the time of the disqualifying\noffences.\n\n*S30(1)(d) the age of the victim at the time of the\ndisqualifying offence and any matters relating to the vulnerability of the\nvictim*\n\n\n1. The\nvictim was 16 years and 10 months of age. As noted in the Trial Judge’s\nsentencing remarks, the applicant and the victim\nhad been in an intimate\nrelationship for some months prior to her death. Other than the victim’s\nage there were no other matters\nrelating to her\nvulnerability.\n\n*S30(1)(e) the difference in age between the victim\nand the applicant and the relationship (if any) between them*\n\n\n1. The\nage gap between the victim and the applicant was 3 years and 10 months. As noted\nabove, the relationship between the applicant\nand the victim was girlfriend and\nboyfriend.\n\n*S30(1)(f) whether the person knew, or could reasonably\nhave known that the victim was a child*\n\n\n1. In\nhis affidavit the applicant said he did not consider the victim to be a child at\nthe time of his offending – she was his\ngirlfriend. However, he is now\nvery well aware of her being a child.\n\n*S30(1)(g) the\napplicant’s present age*\n\n\n1. The\napplicant is now 38 years of age.\n\n*S30(1)(h) the seriousness of\nthe applicant’s total criminal record and the conduct of the person since\nthe offence occurred*\n\n\n1. The\napplicant has no record of any criminal convictions prior to 1999. He was\ncharged, in 1997, with an offence of hindering police\nwhich was later dismissed.\nThe applicant later explained that the charge arose as a result of failing to\nstop for police when directed.\nHe said he had been asked to stop because he was\nnot wearing a bicycle helmet while riding his bicycle.\n2. Other\nthan his manslaughter conviction the applicant has had no record of any further\noffending.\n\n*S30(1)(i) the likelihood of any repetition by the\napplicant of the offence or conduct and the impact on children of any such\nrepetition*\n\n\n1. It\nis the applicant’s contention that the likelihood of him reoffending is\nnil. He said that it is more than 16 years since\nhe offended and he has not\noffended again during this time. He noted that the offence was not intentional\nand any repetition of the\ncircumstances surrounding the offence of re-occurring\nor impacting on children was also nil. In this regard the applicant relied\non\nthe sentencing remarks of the Trial Judge and the report of Dr Gauci.\n2. As\nI have noted, the respondent does not share this view. Of concern to the\nrespondent is the applicant’s failure to access\nand embrace therapeutic\nintervention while in prison and thereafter. That is, the respondent contends\nthe applicant has failed to\naddress his offending and therefore lacks insight\nand remains a risk to the safety of children.\n3. The\nneed for therapeutic intervention was dealt with by Dr Ellard, in his report,\nprepared prior to the applicant’s sentencing\nhearing. In that report Dr\nEllard concluded that there was “one area” in which the applicant\nrequired assistance. He\ndescribed this area as follows:\n\n\n> \n> “As I have said, because of his background he has difficulties in his\n> emotional attachments. This catastrophe has compounded\n> that difficulty. I\n> realise that there are many calls upon the resources on the Department of\n> Corrective Services. If it is possible,\n> it is desirable that he be provided with\n> assistance for his current depression – which is still substantial –\n> and for\n> his emotional problems surrounding close relationships. This could be a\n> complex and prolonged task. It is not a matter of treatment\n> with medication or\n> something of this sort but of working through current difficulties sufficiently\n> for him to be able to lead a normal\n> life in due course.”\n\n1. Dr\nEllard went on to say:\n\n\n> \n> “I do not imply that if this is not done there will be a repetition of\n> what has happened. He has learnt a lot and now feels\n> more supported than he has\n> ever felt before.”\n\n1. In\nthe same report, Dr Ellard gave the following responses to the specific\nquestions that had been asked of him in regard to the\napplicant:\n\n\n> \n> “1. [The applicant] does not have and has not had a\n> formal psychiatric disorder. He was depressed and disturbed at the material\n> time\n> but his degree of depression can be understood in terms of his developmental\n> history and what was happening then.  \n>   \n> \n> 2. The episode has been extremely painful for him and will\n> obviously continue to be very painful for a long time. However I do\n> not think\n> that he will develop a formal mental disorder as a consequence.  \n>   \n> \n> 3. I see no reason to believe that he will commit further\n> offences.  \n>   \n> \n> 4. Maturity is not a simple concept. His academic record\n> suggests that he is of above average intelligence and he told me that\n> his school\n> reports were neither critical nor praising but rather indicated a generally\n> satisfactory level of behaviour and performance.\n> Similarly he said that he\n> related well with his peers; he did not think that they saw him as out of the\n> ordinary in any respect.  \n>   \n> \n> His need was to have someone to love and who would love him. He felt that at\n> least he had found such a person and with threatened\n> loss was unsupportable.  \n>   \n> \n> He said that as a consequence of the episode he had realised that the important\n> people in his life – his mother, father and\n> others – care for him\n> more than they (sic) thought that they did.  \n>   \n> \n> ....  \n>   \n> \n> I do not see him as immature in a general sense of the word. He has continued an\n> educational process in prison with some success.\n> His perception of the prison\n> officers and other prisoners did not suggest immaturity and he has been able to\n> assess how his family\n> and acquaintances have responded to this episode with what\n> seems a reasonable level of maturity. I noted that he did not indulge\n> in\n> self-justification or in the blaming of others.”\n\n1. Subsequently,\nand prior to the sentencing hearing, Dr Ellard was asked to amplify on the area\nin which he had suggested the applicant\nrequired assistance. In his response, Dr\nEllard said the applicant’s immediate need related to his depression and\nhis involvement\nin the tragedy which had occurred. He said that he needed\nassistance from a person with experience in supportive therapy which could\nbe a\npsychiatrist, a psychologist or a general practitioner with a special interest\nin problems of this kind. He went on to say that\nthe second, but not immediate,\nneed was to help him with developmental difficulties that were outlined in his\nreport. He explained\nthat this was a complicated matter and the applicant would\nneed careful assessment to see just how he might cope with it and how\nmotivated\nhe would be to continue after a trial therapy. He also explained that there were\nnot many therapists with the requisite\nskills to undertake such intensive\ntherapy.\n2. The\napplicant did not dispute that he did not seek the assistance of any\npsychologist whilst he was in prison or on parole. In his\naffidavit, the\napplicant explained he did not do so because he was ‘fearful” and\ndid not trust Corrective Service staff.\nHe explained that the mother and\nstepfather of the victim were both high ranking prison officers within the\nDepartment of Corrective\nServices. He said was constantly harassed, victimised,\ndiscriminated against, verbally abused and regularly told that his life was\nin\ndanger while he was in prison. He explained that he was held in maximum security\nfor 99% of his time in prison and that the abuses\nled him to be extremely\ncautious and distrusting of employees of Corrective Services. He understood the\ncounselling service by prison\npsychologists was also part of the Department.\nHowever, he did participate in the available group courses such as\n“Alternative\nto Violence” and anger management.\n3. Instead\nof seeking psychological therapy while in prison, the applicant relied on the\nprison chaplaincy service for his individual\ncounselling. He said that through\nthis service he dealt with his past, the lead up to his offence, the reasons for\nhis offending,\nthe repercussions of his offence, how to deal with grief and loss\nand many other issues relating to his offence and his life and\nbehaviour in\ngeneral. He said this helped him greatly in coming to terms with what he had\ndone, the people he had hurt and effected\nand also helped him to look to the\nfuture.\n4. The\napplicant explained that since leaving prison he has primarily relied on\nfamily.\n5. In\nNovember 2013, when he wanted to seek a working with children check clearance,\nthe applicant consulted Dr Maryann Gauci. He saw\nher for a number of sessions\nand provided him with the risk assessment report for the purpose of his\napplication. In her report,\nDr Gauci said she was of the opinion, based on her\nclinical interviews with the applicant, that he was entirely suitable to work\nwith children and that he held no risk to any children in his care as he was\nextremely unlikely to re-offend or cause any harm to\na child.\n6. In\ncross-examination, the applicant readily acknowledged what Dr Ellard had\nadvised. Nevertheless, he re-iterated he was fearful of\nthe Corrective Service\nstaff, including the psychologists. Counsel for the respondent took the\napplicant to a number of documents,\ncreated by Corrective Service staff, where\nthe applicant had been asked if he had been threatened by staff and his response\nwas recorded\nas not having been threatened. The applicant explained that he\nresponded in that way because he was fearful. In my view, the applicant’s\nexpressions of fear are and were genuinely held by him. As a consequence, the\napplicant had little, if any, confidence or trust in\nthe psychological services\nprovided within the prison. Whether his rejection of these service was an\nover-reaction is not clear.\n7. That\nthe applicant did not engage with the prison psychologists was clearly a matter\nof concern to the applicant’s probation\nand parole officer. In particular\nhis failure to address the issues of violence related to his offending (i.e. a\nviolent reaction\nto rejection – suicide attempt). Notwithstanding these\nconcerns, the applicant was granted parole.\n8. In\nhis response to questioning by counsel of the respondent, the applicant said he\nchose the chaplaincy because they were independent\nof Corrective Services. That\nis, he trusted that service and not that provided by Corrective Services.\n9. In\nhis written submissions, counsel for the respondent contended that the\napplicant’s lack of willingness to access and embrace\ntherapeutic\ntreatment while in prison was of considerable concern. It was inferred the\napplicant had sought a shorter term of imprisonment\n(i.e. head sentence) on the\nbasis of a demonstrated need for extensive long term therapy – when he had\nat no time intended\nto engage with such services. In my view, there is no\nevidence before the Tribunal to support such an inference. Nor, do the\nsentencing\nremarks of the Trial Judge suggest this to have been the case.\n10. The\napplicant has at no time suggested that he did not need to address his\ndifficulties in his emotional attachments and depressed\nmood. Nor do I think, as\nsuggested by counsel for the respondent that the applicant, in choosing the\nprison chaplaincy to address\nthese issues, set himself up as the expert on his\nown therapy. To his mind it was therapy of the kind suggested by Dr Ellard (i.e.\nassistance from a person with the requisite skills in supportive therapy).\nHowever, the question remains as to whether the applicant\nhas addressed his\ndifficulties in his emotional attachments and depressed mood. In many respects\nit appears he has done so as there\nis no further evidence of any further\noffending conduct.\n11. Dr\nGauci, said she believed the applicant had addressed these issues and that he\ndid not need to undergo any further treatment.\n12. Counsel\nfor the respondent, questioned Dr Gauci’s independence and put to her that\nshe had become an advocate for the applicant.\nDr Gauci accepted that her\ndescriptions, in part, were her own personal descriptions. However, she denied\nshe had become his advocate.\nI make no adverse findings against Dr Gauci. I\naccept she treated the applicant and she was of the opinion that he required no\nfurther\ntreatment in regard to his depressed mood. There is also no evidence of\nthe applicant having any further suicidal thoughts.\n13. In\nresponse to a question from Senior Member Andrews, about the applicant having\nnot sought psychological counselling, Dr Gauci said\nthat, notwithstanding the\napplicant’s 2011 angry and abusive email response to BMX Australia, in her\nopinion, the applicant\nwas emotionally stable. She said she felt the chaplaincy\nhad worked for him and that the applicant had worked through and discussed\nwith\nhis family all aspects of his life before the crime and the emotional issues\nwithin his family.\n14. Although\nDr Gauci did not undertake a forensic psychological risk assessment, I do not\nthink her evidence should be given no weight.\n15. The\nquestion remains whether the applicant is likely to repeat conduct of the kind\nthat led to conviction and what impact that would\nhave on children.\n16. The\nrespondent’s concerns arise for Dr Ellard’s diagnosis and suggested\ntreatment to address the applicant’s depressed\nmood and difficulties in\nemotional attachments. This diagnosis and suggested treatment was made some 15\nyears ago. The applicant,\nas I have noted, does not questioned the diagnosis,\nand believes he has been adequately treated through the chaplaincy. While he\nhas\nprovided some explanation of what was spoken about during his meetings with the\nchaplaincy, there is no evidence of the qualifications\nof the persons with whom\nthe applicant consulted. Nevertheless, as I have already explained, I accept the\napplicant benefitted from\nhis engagement with this service.\n17. As\nI have noted, in 2000, Dr Ellard saw no reason why the applicant would\n“commit further offences” and he has not done\nso for 15 years.\nDuring that time, the applicant’s life has changed and he has matured in\nmany respects. Today there are many\nfactors in his favour that are protective\nagainst his risk of re-offending. He is married with a small child, he has the\nsupport\nof his family, he is employed, he has no major mental illness and he has\nno re-occurrence of suicidal ideation.\n18. Accordingly,\nI find that the likelihood of the applicant re-offending is low.\n19. My\nonly reservation is the applicant’s reaction towards those whom he does\nnot trust, or is fearful of. As I have noted, I accept\nthe applicant’s\nfear of Corrective Services staff was genuinely held. His response to his fear\nwas to refuse to engage with\nany staff member wherever possible while he was in\nprison and on parole. As I have explained, whether this was an over-reaction by\nhim is not altogether clear. If it was an over-reaction then his 2011 response\nto BMX Australia is another example of such behaviour.\nThis aspect of the\napplicant’s behaviour and whether it has any relevance to the\napplicant’s previously identified difficulties\nin emotional attachments\nhas not been examined or assessed – in particular in so far as it is\nrelevant to the presumed risk\nto safety of children.\n20. Nevertheless,\nhaving regard to all the information before the Tribunal, I am satisfied that\nthe likelihood of the applicant re-offending,\nas he did in 1996, is\nlow.\n\n*S 30(1)(j) any information given by the applicant in, or in\nrelation to, the application*\n\n\n1. In\nhis affidavit the applicant set out in considerable detail about his passion for\nBMX racing and the achievements that he has obtained\nin more recent years. In\nthis regard the applicant relies on a reference from the National Coaching\nDirector of BMX Australia, the\naffidavit of a director of the Board of BMX NSW\nand the Chief Executive of his local academy of sport.\n2. Each\nreferee makes reference to the applicant’s offending conduct.\nNotwithstanding this conduct, each referee speaks highly\nof the applicant and\nthe contribution he has made to the BMX racing sport. They say they have\nobserved the applicant’s interaction\nwith both adults and children on many\noccasions and they have nothing but admiration for the way in which he conducts\nhimself and\nspeaks to groups generally and for his manner and interaction with\nthe children in the squad when he is coaching.\n3. That\nthe applicant loves his sport is not doubted. He is obviously very good at it\nand has made a valuable contribution to it.\n4. The\napplicant, as I have noted, explained that he has been in employment since the\noccurrence of the offending conduct. The respondent\nhas expressed some concern\nin regard to his employment history as the applicant has refused to provide\ndetails of his employers.\nThe only information provided by the applicant was\nthat there have been no disciplinary issues in regard to his employment. The\napplicant\nwas clearly nervous about his current and former employers being\nsummonsed by the Tribunal, at the request of the respondent. While\nI can\nunderstand the applicant might have some concerns in this regard, the respondent\nhas a right of appearance in these proceedings\nand has an obligation to make\nrelevant enquiries. Again, the applicant’s refusal to provide information\nabout his employers\nis of some concern.\n\n*S30(1)(k) any other\nmatters that the respondent considers necessary*\n\n\n1. The\nrespondent contended that the applicant’s failure to disclose a workplace\ncomplaint for an alleged breach of child employment\nconditions was of\nconsiderable concern.\n2. As\nI have noted, the applicant is an accredited BMX coach with BMX NSW and Cycling\nAustralia. In 2010, as a consequence of a working\nwith children check clearance,\nthe applicant was re-accredited as a BMX coach, with the limitation that he only\ncoach riders 18 years\nand over. Following a process of appeal, BMX Australia\ndetermined to further re-accredit the applicant to coach under 18 year olds,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\t* the applicant\n\twas to be accompanied by an accredited State Level 7 official or Level 1\n\taccredited coach at each of his coaching sessions;\n\t* any coaching\n\tsessions the applicant wished to conduct was to be put in writing with\n\tpermission sought from BMX NSW, with a minimum\n\tof 7 days notice. Each request\n\twas to include the names of the official/coach who would be in attendance at the\n\tproposed coaching\n\tsessions; and\n\t* an authorisation\n\tsheet would be provided by BMX NSW for each coaching session, which had to be\n\tsigned by all in attendance (including\n\tthe gate starter and first aider) and a\n\tcopy of the sheet was to be kept by the applicant, the club and BMX\n\tNSW.\n3. The\napplicant was also advised that if any one of the conditions were not followed,\nBMX NSW would not allow the coaching session to\nproceed and the\napplicant’s coaching accreditation would cease to be valid.\n4. In\nMarch 2011, BMX NSW wrote to the applicant alleging that he had not been\nadhering to his coaching restrictions. It was alleged\nthat on a particular day,\nin February 2011, the applicant did not have a Level 7 official or Level 1\naccredited coach at hand, or\nthat prior approval had been sought as required\nunder the conditions of his accreditation.\n5. The\nallegations were found to be unsubstantiated in that the applicant had not\nundertaken any coaching on the day in question. He\nhad sought and obtained\npermission to undertake coaching on another day.\n6. What\nis of concern to the respondent is the applicant’s failure to disclose\nthis particular complaint and also his very aggressive\nand inappropriate\nresponse to the allegation. As noted by the respondent there is an obligation\nunder subs 28(5) of the Act for the\napplicant to disclose all relevant\ninformation. As I have noted, in response to a question the applicant had been\nasked in correspondence\nfrom the respondent’s solicitor prior to hearing\nas to whether the applicant had been the subject of any complaints. The\napplicant\nhad answered “no” to that question.\n7. Details\nof the complaint came to light in the course of the respondent’s enquiries\nabout the applicant. That is, the information\nwas produced by BMX Australia and\nBMX NSW under a summons issued by the Tribunal, at the request of the\nrespondent.\n8. When\ncross-examined by counsel for the respondent, the applicant explained that he\ndid not understand this to have been a complaint.\nHe said it was initiated by\nBMX NSW and was found to have been a mistake.\n9. The\napplicant also acknowledged that his response to the complaint was\ninappropriate.\n10. In\nmy view nothing substantial turns on this failure. It was clearly an oversight\nand the allegation was at all times unfounded. That\nis, there is no evidence to\nindicate the applicant failed to adhere to the conditions of his\naccreditation.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\n1. The\njurisdiction of the Tribunal is protective and not punitive in nature. However,\nI recognise that if a clearance is refused it\nwill have an adverse effect on the\napplicant. But this is not the issue for determination. What is in issue for\ndetermination is\nwhether, on the material before the Tribunal the applicant has\ndischarged his onus to rebut the presumption that he poses a risk\nto the safety\nof children. That is, has the applicant rebutted the presumption that he poses a\nreal and appreciable risk to the safety\nof children in the context of child\nrelated work.\n2. An\nenabling order cannot be made subject to conditions and in determining this\nmatter paramount consideration is to be given to the\nsafety, welfare and\nwell-being of children and, in particular, protecting them from child\nabuse.\n3. There\nis no dispute the disqualifying offence of which the applicant was convicted was\na serious offence – it involved a child.\nThe Court found the applicant had\nat no time intended to kill or harm the child. It was his physical acts that the\nCourt found to\nbe “unlawful and constituted a dangerous act in the sense\nit exposed [the victim] to a significant risk of serious injury,\nof which risk a\nreasonable person in the position of the [applicant] would have been well\naware.” The applicant does not contend\notherwise.\n4. It\nis now 17 years since the offence was committed and the applicant has not\nre-offended again. Nor is there any evidence of any act\nof violence by the\napplicant prior to the disqualifying offence, or subsequent thereto. He has\nexpressed genuine remorse. The likelihood\nof the applicant re-offending is low\nas there are many factors in favour of the applicant which are protective\nagainst his risk of\nre-offending.\n5. As\nI have noted, my only reservation is whether the applicant has a propensity to\nover-react towards those whom he does not trust,\nor is fearful of. If he does\nhave this propensity to over-react, in my view, it has a bearing on the\napplicant’s previously\nidentified difficulties in emotional attachments\nand depressive mood. That propensity, if correct, may not be substantial, but in\nthe absence of an independent forensic psychological risk assessment (i.e. an\nassessment by a suitably qualified professional who\nhas not treated the\napplicant and who has been provided all the material filed in this application)\nthat addresses this question\nI am unable to find that the applicant has\ndischarged his onus. It may of course be an assessment the applicant is able to\nobtain.\nThis is a matter for him. If he does obtain an assessment of this kind\nand is willing to provide the details of his employers to\nthe respondent, the\napplicant, who has been unrepresented, might seek permission from the respondent\nto make a further application\nfor a clearance under s 21 of the Act (now s 13A\nof the Act as amended by cl 15 of schedule 2 of the *Child Protection\nLegislation Amendment Act 2015*). It will be a matter for the\nrespondent to determine whether to permit the further application within the\nnext 5 years.

These\nproceedings, brought on behalf of the Commission for Children and Young People\n(\"the Commission\") by way of appeal from a decision\nof the Administrative\nDecisions Tribunal of NSW (\"the ADT\") involve a consideration and the\napplication of certain provisions of\nthe *[Commission for Children and Young\nPeople Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/)* 1998 (\"the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/)\"), and in particular [Pt 7](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/index.html#p7)\nthereof.\n\n\n1. The\n[Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) takes as its long title:\n\n\n\"An [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) to establish the Commission for Children and Young People and provide\nfor its functions; to provide for safeguards and impose prohibitions\nrelating to\nchild-related employment; to amend certain Acts; and for other purposes.\"\n\n\n\nIt is the second of these purposes, and the provisions of the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) designed to\nachieve it, that is the focus of the appeal.\n\n\n\n1. A\nnumber of specific provisions of the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) need to be understood for a proper\nappreciation of this judgment. It is convenient to set them out in the order in\nwhich they appear\nin the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/):\n\n\n**\"Part 1 Preliminary**\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**3Definitions**\n\n\n(1)In this [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/): \n\n\n...\n\n\n***children*** means persons under the age of 18 years.\n\n\n***Commission*** means the Commission for Children and Young People\nconstituted by this [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/).\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**[Part 7](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/index.html#p7) Child-related employment**\n\n\n**Division 1 Preliminary**\n\n\n\n**31Object of Part**\n\n\nThe object of this Part is to protect children: \n\n\n(a)by prohibiting certain persons from being involved in child-related\nemployment, and\n\n\n(b)by means of background checking administered by the Commission and other\nagencies.\n\n\n\n**32Safety and welfare of children to be paramount consideration**\n\n\nThe safety and welfare of children and, in particular, protecting them from\nchild abuse, is the paramount consideration in the operation\nof this Part.\n\n\n\n**33Definitions**\n\n\n(1)In this Part: \n\n\n...\n\n\n***child-related employment***: \n\n\n(a)means any employment of the following kind that primarily involves direct\ncontact with children where that contact is not directly\nsupervised by a person\nhaving the capacity to direct the person in the course of the employment: \n\n\n(i)employment involving the provision of child protection services,\n\n\n...\n\n\n(vi)employment in wards of public or private hospitals in which children are\npatients,\n\n\n...\n\n\n(xv)employment involving the provision of counselling or other support\nservices for children,\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n[s 33 in fact identifies 25 specific kinds of employment as \"child-related\nemployment\".

The\nfollowing observations may be made of the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/), so far as is relevant to the\npresent proceedings. The [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) takes as one of its stated purposes the provision\nof safeguards and the imposition of prohibitions relating to child-related\nemployment\n(which is extensively and in considerable detail defined in [s\n33(1)).](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33.html)\n\n\n1. [Part\n7](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/index.html#p7) was enacted with the specific object of protecting children. The paramount\nconsideration in the operation of [Pt 7](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/index.html#p7) is the safety and welfare of children,\nand in particular protecting them from child abuse. One of the means by which\nthe object is\nsought to be achieved is a prohibition on certain persons engaging\nin child-related employment [(s 33C).](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33c.html) These are called \"prohibited persons\". A\npresumption is created [(s 33J(2))](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html) that persons who come within the definition of\n\"prohibited person\" pose a risk to the safety of children. The presumption may\nbe\nrebutted. The onus of rebuttal lies on the prohibited person.\n\n\n1. Division\n2 of [Pt 7](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/index.html#p7) is specifically directed to prohibitions on child-related employment.\nIts central provision is [s 33C](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33c.html), which prohibits (and creates a criminal offence\nof breach of the prohibition) a \"prohibited person\" (i) applying for, (ii)\nattempting\nto obtain, (iii) undertaking, or (iv) remaining in, child-related\nemployment.\n\n\n1. \"Prohibited\nperson\" is defined in [s 33B(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33b.html) to include a person convicted of a serious sex\noffence. \"Serious sex offence\" is defined, relevantly, to include an offence\ninvolving\nsexual activities or acts of indecency committed in NSW and punishable\nby penal servitude or imprisonment for 12 months or more.\nIt is of some interest\nthat there is no requirement that such an offence was committed against a child\n(although some of the other\noffences that constitute serious sex offences do\nhave that requirement). For the purposes of the prohibition, it is immaterial\nwhen\nthe serious sex offence was committed. Moreover, although I have not\ncluttered the above extract of relevant legislation by including\nall of the\noffences that constitute serious sex offences, it is also immaterial that the\noffence was committed outside NSW, provided\nthat the conduct in question would,\nif committed in NSW, have been punishable in the same way.\n\n\n1. Subdivision\n1 is absolute in its terms. It creates an absolute prohibition on the engagement\nby a prohibited person in child-related\nemployment. It is in Sub-div 2 that the\nabsolute quality of Sub-div 1 is, to a limited extent, diluted. Subdivision 2\nmakes provision\nfor some exemptions from the prohibition. It permits an order to\nbe made, on application by a prohibited person, by the Commission\n[(s 33H)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33h.html) or by\na \"relevant tribunal\" [(s 33I)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33i.html) declaring that Div 7 is not to apply to that\nperson in respect of a specified offence. (The ADT and the Industrial Relations\nCommission\n(\"the IRC\") are the \"relevant tribunals\".) Where such an order is in\nforce, the person the subject of the order is not (or ceases\nto be) a prohibited\nperson [(s 33B(2)).](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33b.html) Such an order may be made subject to conditions [(s 33H(3)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33h.html), [s\n33I(6)).](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33i.html) Certain additional provisions, not here relevant, apply when the\nCommission proposes to make, or makes, an order subject to conditions.\nSince\nthose provisions do not apply to an order made by the ADT, it is not necessary\nto take up time with them.\n\n\n1. The\nsame rigorous test applies whether the application is made to the Commission, or\nto either of the relevant tribunals. By [s 33J(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html) an order is not to be made\nunless the Commission or the relevant tribunal is satisfied that the applicant\ndoes not pose a risk to\nthe safety of children. By [s 33J(2)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html) the presumption\nreferred to above, that a prohibited person poses a risk to children, is\ncreated. The circumstances required to be\ntaken into account by the Commission,\nand by the relevant tribunals, in considering an application for such an order,\nare set out\nin [s 33J(3).](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html) They appear in the extracts of the legislation above,\nand it is unnecessary to re-state them here.\n\n\n1. The\nlegislation has, in effect, provided two separate avenues, not mutually\nexclusive, for a prohibited person to seek the exemption\nSub-div 2 envisages.\nOne avenue is to the Commission. The other is to one of the two relevant\ntribunals. Failure to obtain an order\nin the Commission does not preclude an\napplication to a relevant tribunal. Indeed, the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) recognises that the\nCommission may not be in a position to make a decision as to whether the\nprohibited person poses a risk to children\n(or, put another way, whether the\nprohibited person has displaced the presumption created by [s 33J(2)).](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html) (It may be\nsupposed that this is because the Commission acts administratively, and lacks\npowers to obtain evidence that are available\nto tribunals with judicial or\nquasi-judicial authority.) In any event, where the Commission declines to make\nan order, whether because\nit considers that the applicant does pose a risk to\nthe safety of children, or because it considers itself unable to make such a\ndecision, the applicant is entitled to seek an order from a relevant tribunal [(s\n33H(7)).](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33h.html) Further, the Commission is required to notify the applicant of that\nright.\n\n\n1. Finally,\nI note that an appeal, limited to a question of law, lies to this Court from a\ndecision of the ADT (but not the IRC). Left\nunstated is the extent of the power\nof this Court where error of law has been established.\n\n\n1. I\nturn now to the facts of the present case.\n\n\n\n\n**The relevant facts and circumstances**\n\n\n\n1. The\nevidence discloses the following facts. The defendant, who is identified as VR,\nwas born in Iran in 1950. He lived much of his\nlife in Russia and achieved\nqualification in air traffic control engineering in Iran and in pharmacy in the\nPhilippines. Subsequently,\nhe qualified as a medical practitioner in Belarus. He\nwas granted refugee status in Australia in 1984.\n\n\n1. On\n22 August 1991, after a jury trial, he was convicted of one count of indecent\nassault, and two counts of aggravated indecent assault\non a person under the age\nof 16 years and under his authority. The offences were committed in 1985 and\n1986. In each case the victim\nwas the then 10 year old daughter of a woman with\nwhom the defendant lived in a de facto relationship. Each offence rendered the\ndefendant liable to imprisonment for more than 12 months and was therefore a\nserious sex offence within the meaning of [s 33B(3)(a)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33b.html) of the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/),\nand.\n\n\n1. As\na consequence of those convictions the defendant is, within the meaning of [s\n33B(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33b.html) of the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/), a prohibited person (although the offences were committed and\nthe convictions entered before the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) came into force).\n\n\n1. On\n27 January 2010 the defendant applied under [s 33H](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33h.html) of the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) to the Commission\nfor an order declaring that Div 2 of [Pt 7](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/index.html#p7) of the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) does not apply to him in\nrespect of the offences. By [s 33J](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html) the Commission had power to make such an order\nonly if it were affirmatively satisfied that the defendant did not pose a risk\nto\nthe safety of children. On 4 August 2010 the Commission notified the\ndefendant that it was unable to make that determination and\nthat, therefore, it\ncould not make the order he sought. It did not state expressly whether it\nconsidered that he did pose such a\nrisk, or whether there was some other reason\nthat it was unable to reach such a conclusion. In accordance with [s 33H(7)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33h.html) the\nCommission therefore advised the defendant of his right to seek an order from\nthe IRC or the ADT.\n\n\n1. On\n1 September 2010 the defendant made an application to the ADT. He gave as his\nreason for seeking the order that he was unable to\nwork in the medical\nprofession in Australia.\n\n\n1. A\nhearing took place in the ADT, before a judicial member, over four days in May,\nJune and October 2011. The defendant gave evidence.\nExpert reports were\nprovided, and evidence given, by a psychiatrist (Dr Jonathan Phillips), called\nby the Commission, and a psychologist\n(Dr Katie Seidler), called on behalf of\nthe defendant. A report of another psychiatrist, Dr Bruce Westmore, tendered by\nthe defendant,\nwas admitted (over objection), although Dr Westmore was not\navailable to give oral evidence.\n\n\n1. On\n4 May 2012 the ADT handed down its decision. It is unnecessary to go into the\ndetail of the reasoning. The ADT referred at some\nlength to the expert reports,\nand said that it placed greater weight on that of Dr Seidler than that of Dr\nPhillips. The decision\nis largely unexceptional, other than with respect to the\nmatters below. An important aspect of the decision is to be found in para\n108.\nThe ADT said:\n\n\n\"In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that [the defendant] has\nsuccessfully rebutted the presumption of risk to the safety of\nchildren under [s\n33J(2).](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html) Furthermore, having regard to the paramount consideration for the safety\nand welfare of children provided in [s 32](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s32.html) of [the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/)], I do not consider that\n[the defendant] has rebutted the presumption of risk so as to satisfy me that\nthe paramount consideration\nunder the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) could or would be given its true\neffect if the applicant (sic) were to be granted.\"\n\n\n\n1. Translated\ninto the language of [s 33J(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html), this was a clear statement that the ADT was not\nsatisfied that the defendant did not pose a risk to the safety of children. The\nconsequence of that conclusion was that the absolute prohibition on making an\norder contained in that sub-section came into effect.\nIt was not open to the\nADT, in the light of that finding, to make an order of the kind sought by the\ndefendant.\n\n\n1. However,\nthe ADT went on to say, in [109]:\n\n\n\"Having failed to satisfy the Tribunal that he does not pose a risk to the\nsafety of children, it is necessary for me to consider\nwhether conditions can\nand should be imposed on the applicant under [s 33I(6)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33i.html) in order to reduce any\nfuture risk he might present to children in the future.\"\n\n\n\nIn [110] the ADT stated the view that:\n\n\n\n\"... conditions could be imposed to reduce the risk that [the defendant]\nmight present to children.\"\n\n\n\n1. In\nthe result, the ADT made the following order:\n\n\n\"(a) It is declared that Division 2 of [Part 7](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/index.html#p7) of the *[Commission for\nChildren and Young People Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/)* 1998, does not apply to [the defendant] in\nrespect to the offence of indecent assault ... and two counts of indecent\nassault person under\n16 under authority ... subject to the following\nconditions:\n\n\n(i) [the defendant] shall not undertake employment involving children under\nthe age of 18 years; and\n\n\n(ii) [the defendant] shall give a copy of this order to the Chief Executive\nOffice or Clinical Director of any hospital, nursing home\nor medical practice in\nwhich he works. \n\n\n(iii) [the defendant] shall, should he make application to the Australian\nMedical Council for registration as a medical practitioner,\nprovide a copy of\nthese reasons to the Australia (sic) Medical Council.\n\n\n(iv) the Registrar is requested to provide a copy of these orders to the\nCommissioner of Police, New South Wales Police.\"\n\n\n\nIt is against that order that the Commission, as plaintiff, now appeals. \n\n\n\n1. The\ngrounds of the appeal are stated as follows:\n\n\n\"1. The Tribunal at paragraph [108]-[110] misapprehended its powers and\nfunctions under [the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/)] in relation to imposing conditions in order to be\nsatisfied that [the defendant] does not pose a risk to the safety of children,\nper [s 33J(1).](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html)\n\n\n\n2. The imposition of purported condition (i) in the declaration made by the\nTribunal is not authorised by [the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/)].\n\n\n\n3. The Tribunal failed to afford the plaintiff procedural fairness by\nimposing a purported condition which had not been sought by\neither party nor\nraised during the hearing, thereby denying the plaintiff an opportunity to\naddress the Tribunal in relation to the\ncondition.\n\n\n\n4. In the alternative to grounds 1 and 2, the Tribunal failed to give\nadequate reasons for finding that the imposition of a condition\nthat [the\ndefendant] 'not undertake employment involving children under the age of 18\nyears' satisfied the requirement in [s 33J(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html) that [the defendant] 'does not pose\na risk to the safety of children'.\n\n\n\n5. The Tribunal failed to give any reasons, or in the alternative failed to\ngive adequate reasons, for making a declaration that permits\n[the defendant] to\napply for child-related employment, whilst preventing him from 'undertaking\nemployment involving children under\nthe age of 18 years'.\"\n\n\n\n1. The\nprincipal complaint made on behalf of the Commission concerns condition (i) as\nimposed by the ADT. The complaint is that the condition\nis not authorised by the\n[Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/), and that the ADT lacked power to impose it.\n\n\n1. A\nsecondary complaint is based upon the assertion (which was not contested) that\nthe condition was imposed although it had not been\nsought by either party, and\nno notice had been given to the parties of consideration being given to such a\ncondition. A third complaint,\nwhich can be briefly stated, concerns the extent\nto which reasons were given for imposing the condition.\n\n\n1. The\ncomplaint made on behalf of the Commission that the condition was not\n\"authorised\" by the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) is well made. It is true that no explication is provided\nin the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) of the nature of the conditions that might be imposed by the ADT (see\n[s 33I(6)).](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33i.html) A literal reading of [s 33I](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33i.html) (and [s 33H)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33h.html), together with [s 33J(1)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html) and [s\n33J(2)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html), could produce a construction that, unless the [s 33J(2)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33j.html) presumption is\ndisplaced, no order can be made. In that case, the power to impose conditions is\nirrelevant. But if the presumption\nis displaced, then, again, the power to\nimpose conditions is irrelevant.\n\n\n1. The\nissue of conditions has been considered in relation to the predecessor\nlegislation of the [Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/) (the *Child Protection (Prohibition Employment) Act*1998): see *\"R\" v New South Wales Commission for Children and Young People* [[2002] NSWIRComm 101](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%20NSWIRComm%20101 \"View LawCiteRecord\"), per Haylen J, a decision largely endorsed in\n*Commission for Children and Young People v V*  [[2002] NSWSC 949](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/949.html \"View Case\") per Young\nCJ in Eq (as he then was). Although that legislation was not identical to the\nAct, it was substantially similar (with the\nimportant distinction that there was\nno equivalent of the s 33J(2) presumption, a circumstance that Haylen J regarded\nas of some\nsignificance: see [90]-[101]).\n\n\n1. Haylen\nJ and Young CJ in Eq both took the view that the existence of the power to make\nan order subject to conditions must be taken\nto imply that even where the\nCommission or relevant tribunal is not satisfied that the prohibited person does\nnot pose a risk to\nchildren, where the imposition of a condition or conditions\nmay satisfactorily ameliorate that risk, then an order may be made, subject\nto\nthe relevant conditions.\n\n\n1. Although\nthe wording of the Act may not in a literal sense readily accommodate that\napproach, it is in my opinion, the only reasonable\nexplanation for the inclusion\nof the power to make an order subject to conditions. Conditions may be imposed\nthat render a risk that\notherwise would exist, and therefore preclude the making\nof an order and declaration, one within acceptable limits.\n\n\n1. One\nproblem with condition (i) is that it is more restrictive than the prohibition\ncontained in s 33C, when taken with the definition\nof \"child-related\nemployment\". The prohibition is on seeking or engaging in specified employment\n\"**primarily**\" involving direct contact with children (ie persons under 18\nyears of age) unless under the direct supervision of a person in authority.\nThe\ncondition imposed precludes the defendant undertaking any employment involving\nchildren - even where that involvement is not\nthe **primary** focus of the\nemployment, and even where the defendant is under the direct supervision of a\nperson in authority.\n\n\n1. The\ncondition negates, or nullifies, the order, and puts the defendant in a worse\nposition than he would have been in had the order\nnot been made, and the\nstatutory position retained. However, this is not an appeal by the defendant,\nand he makes no complaint about\nthe condition.\n\n\n1. A\nmore important flaw is that, properly analysed, the condition shows clearly (as\nwas stated by the ADT) that the defendant had failed\nto rebut the presumption.\nIt is not a condition that, if observed, ameliorates the risk that the defendant\nis presumed to pose to\nchildren. It underscores that the ADT considers that he\ndoes pose a risk to children. It is therefore correct to say that it is not\na\ncondition authorised by the Act.\n\n\n1. Given\nthat on a proper reading of the ADT's reasons, and the order it made (most\nespecially the condition) the ADT found that the\ndefendant had failed to\ndisplace the s 33J(2) presumption, it was not open to the ADT to make the order\nand the declaration.\n\n\n1. At\nthe hearing of the appeal, counsel who appeared for the defendant conceded that\nthere were \"real difficulties\" in the decision,\nand, sensibly, did not attempt\nto support it. The concession was well made.\n\n\n1. Error\nof law has been established. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the\nremaining grounds of appeal. The appeal must be allowed.\n\n\n**Orders**\n\n\n\n1. As\nI have mentioned above, the Act does not specify what orders this Court can make\nfollowing an appeal.\n\n\n1. Recourse\nwas therefore had to [s 75A](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s75a.html) of the *[Supreme Court Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/)* 1970, which, it seems\nto me, is the only legislation applicable. Although that section (by sub-s (4))\nhas effect subject to any other\nAct, no other Act was advanced as limiting its\napplicability. By sub-s (10) this Court may make any finding or assessment, give\nany\njudgment, make any order or give any direction which ought to have been\ngiven or made or which the nature of the case requires.\n\n\n1. That\nis a very broad power.\n\n\n1. Counsel\nfor the defendant did not advance any argument to the contrary of that\nproposition. Accordingly, the orders I make are:\n\n\n(i)Appeal allowed;\n\n\n\n(ii)The decision of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal of 4 May 2012 is\nset aside;\n\n\n\n(iii)The defendant's application for an order under [s 33I](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/s33i.html) of the\n*[Commission for Children and Young People Act](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/)* 1998 declaring that [Pt 7](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfcaypa1998397/index.html#p7),\nDiv 2 of that Act does not apply to the defendant in relation to the offences of\nindecent assault and two counts of aggravated indecent\nassault is dismissed.\n\n\n\n1. The\nplaintiff also sought an order that the defendant pay the costs of the\nproceedings. I have given consideration to that. However,\nin the light of the\nuncontested assertion on behalf of the Commission that the error was in no way\ninduced or contributed to by the\ndefendant, it seems to me that it would be\nunfair to visit the costs of correction on him. In this respect it is relevant\nthat he\nvery sensibly (through his counsel) did not attempt to defend the order.\nI decline to make an order for costs.\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In\nthis matter the Tribunal refused and dismissed an application for a stay order\nby reasons for decision published 1 August 2014:\n*BJB v NSW Office of the\nChildren's Guardian* [[2014] NSWCATAD 111](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/111.html \"View Case\") (\"the interim decision\"). The matter\nwas adjourned for hearing to 1 and 2 September 2014. The hearing occurred on\nthose 2 days with\noral evidence in addition to the documentary material filed in\nsupport of both parties' cases.\n\n\n1. At\nthe commencement of the hearing an order was made pursuant to section 64 of the\n*Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013* (\"the CAT Act\") restricting\npublication of information that will identify the applicant, any victims,\nwitnesses, or evidence given\nand received in the Tribunal hearing or in relation\nto the proceedings which is likely to identify those persons.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant who is referred to in these proceedings by the letters \"BJB\" filed on\n4 June 2014 an application for review of a decision\nby the Children's Guardian.\nThe review is pursuant to section 27 of the *Child Protection (Working with\nChildren) Act 2012* (\"the Act\").\n\n\n1. The\napplicant applied for a Working with Children check clearance from the\nrespondent on 20 November 2013 which resulted in a review\nof records which\ntriggered a risk assessment under the Act: see Part 3, Division 3 of the\nAct.\n\n\n1. That\nassessment resulted in an interim bar on 20 March 2014 which made it an offence\nfor the applicant to work in child-related roles,\nwhether paid or voluntary. The\napplicant was notified on 17 April 2014 that the respondent proposed to refuse\nhis application and\nrequested any further information the applicant wished to\nprovide in further support of the application by 15 May 2014.\n\n\n1. The\nrespondent refused the Working with Children Check clearance on 2 June 2014. The\nrespondent determined that the applicant poses\na risk to children. That decision\nis the subject of this review.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant filed an application for a stay of the decision with his application\nfor review on 4 June 2014 under section 27 of the\nAct. The stay application was\nlisted for hearing on 19 June 2014 before a differently constituted Tribunal.\nThat stay was not able\nto be determined because at that stage no evidence had\nbeen filed by either party.\n\n\n1. This\nmatter was originally listed for hearing on 17 July 2014. The day before the\nscheduled hearing, the Solicitors for the applicant\nwho had only been recently\ninstructed by the applicant, sent a letter to the Tribunal Registry advising\nthat the applicant sought\nan adjournment of the final hearing. That adjournment\napplication was not opposed and because the witness required for cross\nexamination\nfrom the Office of the Children's Guardian was unable to attend on\nthat day it was adjourned. The stay application has been\ndetermined.\n\n\n1. The\nissue before the Tribunal is to decide in these proceedings is what \"*the\ncorrect and preferable decision is having regard to the material then before\nit*\" including material which may not have been before the Children's\nGuardian: section 63 *Administrative Decisions Review Act\n1997*.\n\n\n**The evidence relied upon in the hearing**\n\n\n\n1. The\napplicant relied upon the following documentary material:\n\n\n\n> \n> (1) Affidavit by BJB filed 27 August 2014;\n\n\n\n> \n> (2) Affidavit by the wife of BJB filed 27 August 2014;\n\n\n\n> \n> (3) Letter of reference by the present Vice President of the Australian Foster\n> Care Association filed 27 August 2014;\n\n\n\n> \n> (4) A bundle of documents filed by the applicant on 2 July\n> 2014;\n\n\n\n> \n> (5) A letter dated 30 August 2014 from a counsellor for BJB who advised she\n> required a subpoena in order to attend to give evidence\n> (that was issued and the\n> witness gave oral evidence);\n\n\n\n> \n> (6) Letters and references from Dr Pusic psychiatrist dated 23 March 2009, 10\n> January 2014, and 26 June 2014 concerning his treatment\n> of\n> BJB;\n\n\n\n> \n> (7) Reports from Dr Christopher Lennings, psychologist concerning risk\n> assessment of BJB dated 14 November 2008, 2 December 2008,\n> and 1 August\n> 2014;\n\n\n\n> \n> (8) Report by the counsellor for BJB dated September 2009 and certificate dated\n> 26 August 2009 from '*Enough is Enough'* concerning the applicant's\n> attendance at a stress and anger management course of 4 individual sessions and\n> 1 group workshop.\n\n\n1. The\nrespondent relied upon the following documentary material:\n\n\n\n> \n> (1) A bundle of documents compiled by the respondent including the reports and\n> correspondence prepared by the respondent together\n> with the material collected\n> by the respondent pursuant to section 31 of the Act;\n\n\n\n> \n> (2) A chronology prepared by counsel for the respondent;\n\n\n\n> \n> (3) Selected tagged documents from the material produced by St John of God\n> Hospital;\n\n\n\n> \n> (4) Selected tagged documents from the file produced by \"Enough is\n> Enough\";\n\n\n\n> \n> (5) Respondent's Written Outline of Submissions dated 2 September\n> 2014.\n\n\n1. The\ntribunal heard oral evidence and cross-examination from the applicant, his wife,\nthe Vice President of the Australian Foster Care\nAssociation, Dr Pusic, Dr\nLennings, and the counsellor for BJB from \"*Enough is\nEnough*\".\n\n\n1. The\nonly witness cross-examined for the respondent was Ms Crawcour who provided the\nrecommendations contained in her reports based\nupon the material she had\nreceived and reviewed in relation to BJB.\n\n\n1. The\nTribunal was also assisted by oral submissions from the representatives of the\nparties after the evidence had completed.\n\n\n1. A\nstatement contained in these reasons of a factual matter is a finding of fact\nbased upon the evidence referred to in these reasons.\n\n\n**The Relevant Legal Principles**\n\n\n\n1. The\nAct came into force on 15 June 2013.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant requires a Working with Children Check clearance because he is an\nauthorised carer with his wife for a child under the\nage of 18 years pursuant to\nthe *[Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caypapa1998442/)*, therefore\nengaging in child-related work as defined in section 6 of the Act. A worker must\nnot engage in child-related work unless\nhe holds such a clearance: section 8 of\nthe Act. The applicant cannot continue as and cannot reside with an authorised\ncarer without\na clearance: section 10 of the Act.\n\n\n1. The\nobjects of the Act are set out in section 3 which provides:\n\n\n\"Object of Act\n\n\n\nThe object of this Act is to protect children:\n\n\n\n(a) by not permitting certain persons to engage in child-related work,\nand\n\n\n\n(b) by requiring persons engaged in child-related work to have working with\nchildren check clearances.\"\n\n\n\n1. The\nparamount principle to be applied in decisions under the Act is contained in\nsection 4 which provides:\n\n\n\"Safety, welfare and well-being of children to be paramount consideration\n\n\n\nThe safety, welfare and well-being of children and, in particular, protecting\nthem from child abuse, is the paramount consideration\nin the operation of this\nAct.\"\n\n\n\n1. \"***Children***\"\nis defined in section 5 (1) of the Act to mean \"*persons under the age of 18\nyears.*\"\n\n\n1. The\nmatters referred to under Schedule 1 of the Act which triggered a risk\nassessment by the Children's Guardian are those matters\nreferred to in clause 1\n(6) and clause 2 (a) of Schedule 1. As referred to in the interim decision in\nthis matter, either one of\nthese matters is sufficient to trigger a risk\nassessment requirement under section 15 (1) of the Act. This is because section\n14\nof the Act requires a risk assessment if *any* of the matters specified\nin Schedule 1 of the Act apply to the person.\n\n\n1. Clause\n1 (6) of Schedule 1 of the Act provides:\n\n\n\"A person has been convicted of, or proceedings have been commenced against a\nperson for, offences involving violence or sexual misconduct\n(whether or not\nlisted in this Schedule or Schedule 2) sufficient to indicate a pattern of\nbehaviour that warrants investigation\nas to whether it may cause a risk to the\nsafety of children.\"\n\n\n\n1. Clause\n2 (a) of Schedule 1 of the Act provides:\n\n\n\"Findings of misconduct involving children\n\n\n\nA person has been the subject of a finding by a reporting body that the\nperson engaged in the following conduct:\n\n\n\n(a) sexual misconduct committed against, with or in the presence of a child,\nincluding grooming of a child,\n\n\n\n(b) any serious physical assault of a child.\"\n\n\n\n1. The\ncurrent hearing before the Tribunal is pursuant to an application under section\n27 (1) of the Act. The requirement for an internal\nreview imposed by section 53\nof the *Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997* does not apply to this\ndecision: see section 27 (7) of the Act.\n\n\n1. Pursuant\nto section 27 (4) of the Act *\"the applicant must fully disclose to the\nTribunal any matters relevant to the application*.\"\n\n\n1. The\nguiding principle to be applied to practice and procedure in the Tribunal \"*is\nto facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the\nproceedings*\" consistent with the objects and principles under the *Child\nProtection (Working with Children) Act 2012*: section 36 of the CAT\nAct.\n\n\n1. The\nTribunal may determine its own procedure in relation to any matter for which the\nCAT Act or *Civil and Administrative Rules 2014* do not otherwise make\nprovision. Additionally, the Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence\n(except in relation to privileged\ndisclosures, for example under [section 128](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html) of\nthe *[Evidence Act 1995](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/)*), and is to act with as little formality as the\ncircumstances permit to appropriately determine matters without regard to\ntechnicalities\nor legal form: sections 38, and 67 of the CAT\nAct.\n\n\n1. Procedural\nfairness and other aspects of natural justice, of course, are to apply to these\nproceedings and the Tribunal has a discretion\nto act on material which is\nrationally probative, but must determine in all the circumstances whether it is\nproper to act on that\nmaterial and must act fairly towards the parties:\n*Commission for Children and Young People v FZ* [[2011] NSWCA 111](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2011/111.html \"View Case\");\n*Roberts v Balancio* [(1987) 8 NSWLR 436.](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20436 \"View LawCiteRecord\")\n\n\n1. The\nAdministrative and Equal Opportunity Division (\"AEOD\") of the Tribunal has its\npractice and procedure prescribed by reason of\nSchedule 3 of the CAT Act.\nRelevantly, a party to proceedings in this division is entitled to be\nrepresented by a lawyer without\nrequiring leave of the Tribunal and there are no\ncosts awarded in proceedings under the Act. A party aggrieved by a decision made\nunder the Act in AEOD may appeal directly to the Supreme Court on a question of\nlaw: see sections 16, 17 and Schedule 3, clauses\n9, 15, and 17 of the CAT\nAct.\n\n\n1. It\nis also relevant to observe that conditions of authorised care may be imposed\npursuant to [section 137](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caypapa1998442/s137.html) of the *[Children and Young Persons (Care and\nProtection) Act 1998](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caypapa1998442/)* and clause 34 of the *Children and Young Persons\n(Care and Protection) Regulation 2012*. The applicant and his wife provide\nauthorised care and proceedings in 2009 in the then Administrative Decisions\nTribunal pursuant\nto [section 245](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caypapa1998442/s245.html) of the *[Children and Young Persons (Care and\nProtection) Act 1998](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caypapa1998442/)* restored their status as authorised carers subject to\nsome undertakings. If the applicant is not complying or does not comply in\nthe\nfuture with those undertakings, the Department of Family and Community Services\nmay take appropriate action. Those undertakings\nmay have limited relevance to a\ndecision under the Act to determine whether the applicant poses a risk to the\nsafety of children.\n\n\n1. As\nwas observed in the interim stay decision (at [110]), the jurisdiction of the\nTribunal under section 27 of the Act is protective\nand not punitive in nature:\n*AYU v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian* [2014] NSWCATAD to 9, at\n[34]; *Commission for Children and Young People v FZ* [[2011] NSWCA 111](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2011/111.html \"View Case\"), per\nYoung JA at [61] and *R v Commission for Children and Young People* [[2002]\nNSWIRComm 101](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWIRComm/2002/101.html \"View Case\") at [[130]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWIRComm/2002/101.html#para130).\n\n\n1. In\nthe helpful written submissions provided by the respondent's counsel Ms\nHartstein, it was observed that there is currently no precedent\ndecision in\nrelation to the standard of proof or onus of proof which is applicable on a\nreview pursuant to section 27 of the Act.\nThat may change in the event that any\nof the decisions are taken on appeal to the Supreme Court. For present purposes\nthe relevant\napplicable standard is the civil onus: the balance of probabilities\nas modified by [section 140(2)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s140.html) of the *[Evidence Act 1995](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/)* (NSW). Neither\nparty bears an onus of proof in relation to an application under section 27 of\nthe Act: see *Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous\nAffairs v QAAH of 2004* [[2006] HCA 53](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2006/53.html \"View Case\"); [(2006) 231 CLR 1](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282006%29%20231%20CLR%201 \"View LawCiteRecord\") at [[39]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2006/53.html#para39)- [[40]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2006/53.html#para40). The Tribunal has to\nconsider all of the evidence whether adduced by the applicant or the respondent\nin the light of and under the\nmandated considerations contained in sections 15\nand 30 of the Act. As adverted to earlier in these reasons the Tribunal is to\nact\nwith as little formality as the circumstances permit to appropriately\ndetermine matters without regard to technicalities or legal\nform: section 38 of\nthe CAT Act; *Kostas v HIA Insurance Services Pty Limited* [[2010] HCA 32](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2010/32.html \"View Case\") at\n [[15]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2010/32.html#para15)- [[17]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2010/32.html#para17). Ultimately, the Tribunal is the decision maker and can have regard to\n'any' material subject to the rules of natural justice: section\n63 of the\n*Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997*.\n\n\n1. The\ntest to be applied when considering earlier predecessor legislation is whether\nthe risk is \"*a real and appreciable risk*\": see *BYR v Children's\nGuardian* [[2013] NSWADT 310](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2013/310.html \"View Case\"), at [38], [39]; *AYU v NSW Office of the\nChildren's Guardian* [[2014] NSWCATAD 9](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/9.html \"View Case\"), at [37], [38]; *Commission for\nChildren and Young People v V* [[2002] NSWSC 949](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/949.html \"View Case\"); [56 NSWLR 476](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=56%20NSWLR%20476 \"View LawCiteRecord\"), at [42] per\nYoung CJ in Eq (as he then was). That test has been held to be applicable in\nthese matters in the Tribunal: see *AHV v NSW Commission for Children and\nYoung People* [[2012] NSWADT 263](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2012/263.html \"View Case\"); *AYU v NSW Office of the Children's\nGuardian* (supra). Both counsel submitted that it was the appropriate test in\nthis application.\n\n\n1. It\nwas also submitted by counsel for the respondent that the \"*unacceptable risk\nof harm*\" test is not applicable to decisions under section 27 of the Act. In\nthe interim decision in this matter the Tribunal discussed this\ntest of\n\"*unacceptable risk of harm*\" which is regularly applied in children's\nmatters under the *[Family Law Act 1975](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/) (Cth)* and in the State jurisdiction\nin the Children's Court under the *[Children and Young Persons (Care and\nProtection) Act 1998](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caypapa1998442/)*. The wording and application of this test arises from\nthe decision of the High Court in *M v M* [[1988] HCA 68](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/68.html \"View Case\"); [166 CLR 59](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=166%20CLR%2059 \"View LawCiteRecord\"), which\nwas not cited in the judgments referred to as establishing the test of *\"a\nreal and appreciable risk*\".\n\n\n1. It\nis therefore incumbent upon this Tribunal to apply the \"*real and appreciable\nrisk*\" formulation and determine whether the applicant poses a risk in that\nsense to the safety of children as required by the Supreme\nCourt precedents\ncited.\n\n\n1. An\nenabling order pursuant to section 28 of the Act, in relation to a disqualified\nor ineligible person, may not be made subject to\nconditions: section 28 (8) of\nthe Act. It is apparent that there is no similar explicit statutory restriction\nnor is there any explicit\nstatutory approval of conditions which may be attached\nto the grant a Working with Children Check clearance under section 27 of the\nAct.\n\n\n1. The\nregister of clearances required to be maintained by the Children's Guardian\npursuant to section 25 of the Act makes no reference\nto separately registering\nthe conditions upon which clearances may be granted. These are matters to which\nthe Tribunal adverted in\nthe interim decision.\n\n\n1. The\ntransitional provisions contained in Part 2 of Schedule 3 of the Act contains at\nclause 6 a clear statement that a person who\nis the subject of an unconditional\nexisting declaration in force immediately before the repeal of the former\nprovisions, is taken\nto be the subject of an order under part 4 of the Act\ndeclaring that the person concerned is not to be treated as a disqualified\nperson in respect of the offence. All other people, that is, persons who have\nconditional existing declarations under the former\nprovisions prior to the\ncommencement of the current Act, are to be treated as disqualified persons for\nthe purposes of the Act. These\nprovisions lend weight to the argument that any\nconditional declaration is not permitted under the provisions of the\nAct.\n\n\n1. The\nChildren's Guardian submits in the written submissions provided to the Tribunal\nthat it is not appropriate for the Tribunal to\nmake an order on conditions,\nwhether that be under section 27 or section 28 of the Act.\n\n\n1. In\norder to confirm that the meaning of a provision is the ordinary meaning\nconveyed by the text of the provision, regard may be given\nto extrinsic material\nsuch as the second reading speech of the Minister on the occasion of the moving\nby that Minister of a motion\nthat the Bill which becomes the Act be read a\nsecond time in that house of Parliament: [section 32](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s32.html) (2) (f) of the\n*[Interpretation Act 1987](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/)*.\n\n\n1. The\nsecond reading speech for the Bill which became the Act, by Mr Dominello, The\nMinister for Citizenship and Communities, and Minister\nfor Aboriginal Affairs on\n13 June 2012 contains the following:\n\n\n\"All adults can present a risk to children. The Bill does not propose that\nall adults be barred from working with children because\nof a hidden potential\nfor risk. Rather, the Bill proposes that to bar a person from working with\nchildren the risk must be significant.\"\n\n\n\n1. In\nthe following paragraph the Minister stated:\n\n\n\"While the bill sets out the factors to be considered in an assessment and a\nreview, the weighting given to these factors is not prescribed\nand is a matter\nof expert judgment. Expert judgment will consider the significance of the harm\nhaving been realised, whether the\nbehaviour was beyond reasonable community\nnorms, whether the behaviour was planned, whether the behaviour is part of the\npattern\nof ongoing or escalating events, whether the behaviour is recent, and\nwhether the behaviour, if repeated, would do significant harm.\nExpert judgment\nwill be applied to mitigating factors such as significant and sustained positive\nsocialisation since the behaviour\noccurred, recurrence or cessation of\nconcerning behaviour is over a significant period, and genuine and sustained\neffort to remedy\nthe conduct and past behaviour. Remorse on its own is not\nconsidered to be a factor that mitigates risk.\"\n\n\n\n1. As\nthe Tribunal observed in *BFX v Children's Guardian* [[2014] NSWCATAD 115](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/115.html \"View Case\") at\n [[43]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/115.html#para43)- [[48]](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/115.html#para48) these extracts from the second reading speech assist in the\ninterpretation of the requirements contained in the Act, and, with respect\nto\nthe previous judicial pronouncements, where the real and appreciable risk, as\nthe Minister emphasised in slightly different words\nbut with similar meaning and\nimport, must be linked to the safety of children, those pronouncements are\nappropriate in the interpretation\nof the current Act.\n\n\n1. In\nrelation to whether conditions may be imposed when granting a working with\nchildren check clearance under section 27, the Minister's\nsecond reading speech\nalso states:\n\n\n\"Matters may be reheard if the commission has new evidence. The\nAdministrative Decisions Tribunal must consider the same issues that\nthe\ncommission considers in an assessment. It may determine that the person remains\nbarred or it may order the commission to issue\na clearance. The Administrative\nDecisions Tribunal may not issue any order with conditions. This is an important\nclarification of\nthe current process where orders have, on occasion, been issued\nwith conditions. The difficulty with conditions is that they need\nto be\nmonitored and neither the commission nor any other body has statutory powers or\nresources for this purpose. The new Working\nwith Children Check operates on a\nvery simple assumption: A person is allowed to work with children or is not\nallowed to work with\nchildren.\"\n\n\n\n1. If\n\"commission\" is substituted by \"Children's Guardian\", and \"Administrative\nDecisions Tribunal\" is replaced by the \"Tribunal\" in\nthat extract from the\nsecond reading speech, it can be seen that the intent of the Working with\nChildren Check clearance process\nis to deliver one of two possible outcomes\nwithout any conditions attached to that outcome whether that occurs at the\ninitial stage\nof decision-making by the Children's Guardian or in the Tribunal\nas a result of a review decision.\n\n\n**The Issues**\n\n\n\n1. The\nprimary issue before the Tribunal in this application, is what the correct and\npreferable decision is having regard to the material\nbefore the Tribunal in\nrelation to the granting of a working with children check clearance in relation\nto the applicant: section\n63 *Administrative Decisions Review Act\n1997*.\n\n\n1. There\nis no presumption that the applicant poses a risk to children as there would be\nif the applicant were a disqualified person\nseeking an enabling order: cf.\nsection 28(7) of the Act.\n\n\n**Consideration of the Evidence**\n\n\n\n1. The\nTribunal has had the benefit of oral evidence in addition to the documentary\nevidence. The applicant and the other witnesses called\nin the hearing were able\nto be assessed by the Tribunal in relation to their documentary evidence by the\nanswers they gave in questions\nput to them during the course of the\nhearing.\n\n\n1. The\nTribunal \"*must consider*\" those factors set out in section 30 (1) in\ndetermining an application under Part 4 of the Act, which includes this\napplication.\nThe Children's Guardian in determining the risk assessment \"*may\nconsider*\" matters set out in section 15 (4) of the Act which are more aptly\ndescriptive of that process than section 30 (1) of the Act. It\nis relevant to\nnote that the factors contained in both subsections address the same\nconsiderations expressed in slightly different\nlanguage. Since the Tribunal is\nconducting an administrative review by reason of section 27 of the Act it\nappears appropriate to\nhave regard to both sections 30 (1) and section 15 (4)\nconsiderations as required by both sections. That would fulfil the requirements\nof both sections, taking into account the nature of the administrative\nreview.\n\n\n1. The\nTribunal considered the evidence which was relied upon for the interim hearing\nin the previous judgment but is now required to\ndecide the matter in accordance\nwith the legislative requirements set out in the previous paragraphs when making\nthe final determination.\nTherefore the Tribunal must consider each of the\nsubparagraphs in section 30 of the Act and the evidence which relates to each of\nthose considerations in order to arrive at a final determination.\n\n\n1. There\nwill therefore be a necessity to repeat some of the evidence previously\nconsidered, supplemented by the evidence which was called\nat the final hearing\nin support of the respective cases of the applicant and the\nrespondent.\n\n\n1. The\nevidence will be considered under each of the following subheadings. Each of the\nsubheadings combine the considerations under\nsection 15 and section 30 of the\nAct.\n\n\n**The seriousness of the offences with respect to which the person is a\ndisqualified person or any matters that caused an assessment\nand a refusal of a\nclearance or imposition of an interim bar**\n\n\n\n1. The\napplicant is not a disqualified person under the Act. It is clear from the\nevidence that the applicant has been convicted of a\nnumber of offences which are\nrelevant to the considerations before the Tribunal.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant has been convicted of offences involving violence and in particular\noffences of domestic and personal violence. The\napplicant did not raise\nobjection to the material produced by the respondent referring to the incidents\nof violence and the criminal\nhistory of the applicant. Dr Lennings, the expert\nretained by the applicant to assess risk, has also referred to these offences.\nAs previously noted, because the rules of evidence do not apply in these\nproceedings, the restrictions imposed by [section 91](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s91.html) of the *[Evidence Act\n1995](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/)* (NSW) do not apply: section 38 of the CAT Act. The Tribunal may\ntherefore look at the surrounding circumstances in relation to the\noffences upon\nwhich the applicant has been convicted.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant was convicted of 2 counts of common assault under [section 61](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s61.html) of the\n*[Crimes Act 1900](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/)* (NSW) on 26 August 2003 and sentenced to a section 9 bond\nunder the *[Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1999278/)* (NSW) for 2 years under\nthe supervision of the probation and parole service. This offence carries a\nmaximum sentence of 2 years imprisonment.\nGiven the sentence which was received\nby the applicant these offences could not be considered at the most serious end\nof the scale.\nHowever, there are a number of disturbing features about these\noffences.\n\n\n1. The\nfacts in relation to the convictions of common assault referred to in the\nprevious paragraph, are that the victims are the sister-in-law\nof the applicant\nand her sister. The applicant entered the first victim's home by kicking in the\nscreen door and a wooden door. The\napplicant is alleged to have pushed her to\nthe ground. He grabbed her by the hair and told her she was coming with him when\nshe told\nhim where the sister-in-law was located. The applicant dragged her to\nthe front door and walked with her to where the sister-in-law\nwas with her five\nchildren. The applicant grabbed the sister-in-law's phone from her and threw it\nat the video recorder causing the\nphone cord to disconnect from the handset and\ndamaging the video recorder. The applicant admitted, to the police, kicking in\nthe\ndoor but denied, at the time of his arrest, assaulting either\nvictim.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant was convicted of two counts of assault occasioning actual harm under\n[section 59](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s59.html) (1) of the *[Crimes Act 1900](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/)* (NSW) on 22 June 2004 and received\na suspended sentence of 16 months imprisonment, upon entering a bond under\n[section 12](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1999278/s12.html) of the *[Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1999278/)* (NSW) and\nsupervision by the probation and parole service. The applicant was liable to be\nsentenced to a maximum of five years imprisonment\nin relation to each of these\noffences.\n\n\n1. The\nvictim of the assault referred to in the previous paragraph is the applicant's\nwife. The applicant became angry after his wife\nreturned from her solicitors and\nshe gave him some papers. The wife received a telephone call from the Department\nof Community Services\n(as it then was). The applicant picked up a wooden tray\nand threw it at his wife's chest striking her and causing bruising. She went\nto\nher bedroom and the applicant followed her, subsequently punching her with a\nclosed fist to the right side of her face. The wife\nis reported to have suffered\nheadache, a lump to her head, bruising and swelling to her right forearm. At\nsome point later in the\nday the applicant's wife returned home believing him to\nhave left the home. The applicant kicked down the back door. The wife went\nto\nthe neighbour's house to call the police. The applicant followed her and knocked\non the neighbour's door. When the wife walked\ninto the driveway of the\nneighbour's house to talk to the applicant, her mother reversed her car in the\ndriveway calling for the\nwife to leave, at which time the applicant became\nangry. The wife walked back towards the neighbour's house and the applicant\ngrabbed\nher by the head and reportedly slammed her head into a brick wall. The\nwife fell to the ground and the applicant kicked her in the\nstomach. Neighbours\ncame to the aid of the wife and the applicant left. An ambulance was called. The\nwife suffered a broken blood\nvessel in one eye, a haematoma on her forehead and\na cut. There was also a small bruise on her stomach and a number of scratches\nand grazes on her arms.\n\n\n1. On\n4 November 2009 the applicant was convicted of another assault occasioning\nactual bodily harm. On this occasion he received a suspended\nsentence of\nimprisonment for 12 months on entering a [section 12](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1999278/s12.html) bond under the *[Crimes\n(Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1999278/)* (NSW) for 12 months. This was a serious\noffence constituting the assault upon the 18-year-old former foster daughter of\nthe applicant\n(and his wife) in the presence of a number of students who were\nthe daughter's pupils. The pupils were all children. The assault\noccurred the\nprevious year on 15 September 2008. The Tribunal was informed that the applicant\naccepted this was a serious offence.\n\n\n1. Indeed,\nthis was a serious assault upon a young woman who was a former foster child of\nthe applicant and his wife. The circumstances\nof the assault do the applicant no\ncredit. The applicant hit and pushed the young woman into a garden bed and when\nshe was on her\nback, he straddled her and punched her to the head with both his\nright and left fists (not exceeding five times). The victim was\ntaken to\nhospital with swelling and bruising to her right ear and head and superficial\nscratch marks to her neck.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant was later convicted of stalk, intimidate, intend to cause fear of\nphysical/mental harm under [section 13](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/capva2007347/s13.html) (1) of the *[Crimes (Domestic and\nPersonal Violence) Act 2007](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/capva2007347/)* (NSW) and was sentenced to a [section 9](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/capva2007347/s9.html) bond\nunder the *[Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1999278/)* (NSW) for a duration of\ntwo years. The applicant became involved in an argument with his wife in the\npresence of the children on\n8 October 2008 after returning from St John of God\nHospital. The applicant followed his wife and the two foster children in a car\nand became involved in a domestic violence incident. This incident was\nfrightening and dangerous. The applicant drove dangerously\ncausing the wife to\nstop the car resulting ultimately in the applicant violently grabbing the\ndriver's window out of the door causing\nglass fragments through the inside of\ncar and onto the road in the presence of the children. The applicant was\narrested and taken\nto the police station from the scene of the serious incident.\nIt is fortunate that no one was seriously injured or killed as a result\nof the\napplicant's aggressive and thoughtless behaviour. The applicant is extremely\nlucky that he was not facing more serious charges\nas a result of this\nincident.\n\n\n1. These\nincidents fall within the description contained in clause 1 (6) of schedule 1 of\nthe Act. They are events which cause or \"trigger\"\nan assessment of risk by the\nChildren's Guardian pursuant to section 15 (1) of the Act. This assessment is\nbefore the Tribunal, and\nthe young woman who submitted the assessment was\ncross-examined.\n\n\n1. During\nthe process of assessment the Children's Guardian had regard to an incident\nreported to have occurred on 22 November 2003.\nAn AVO had been made in relation\nto the 14-year-old foster child in the applicant and his wife's care. The\napplicant had an argument\nwith his wife in front of the children. The applicant\nkicked and broke a chair and broke all the presents that had been purchased\nfor\nthe child for Christmas. The applicant's wife tried to leave the home with the\nchildren but the applicant prevented her from\nusing the family car, forcing her\nto flee on foot. The applicant's wife signed an agreement the following day that\nshe would not\nallow the applicant back into the home. On 2 January 2004 the\napplicant telephoned the caseworker stating he had been in the home\nall along\ndespite the agreement signed by the wife. The children were removed from the\napplicant and his wife's care that day.\n\n\n1. In\nthe documentary material produced by the respondent, an incident is recorded to\nhave occurred when the children were present on\n18 November 2008. This incident\nwas an incident of verbal domestic violence. The applicant was admitted into\nNepean Mental Health\nHospital following this incident.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant disputes the allegation that he sexually abused the 14-year-old foster\ndaughter in his care in 2003.\n\n\n1. The\nreported incident concerning that allegation of sexual abuse was investigated\nand the circumstances were \"*confirmed*\" resulting in the removal of the\nfoster daughter from the applicant's care. The victim's three siblings were also\nremoved from his\ncare. The applicant and his wife brought proceedings in the\nAdministrative Decisions Tribunal which were finalised on 11 March 2004\n(with\nwritten reasons on 3 June 2004). The three siblings were subsequently restored\nto the care of the applicant and his wife. It\nwas submitted by the applicant\nthat the findings made by the Administrative Decisions Tribunal were that \"*in\nall likelihood the abuse never happened.*\" There were no criminal charges\nlaid as a result of this allegation.\n\n\n1. In\nthe interim decision (*BJB v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian* [[2014]\nNSWCATAD 111)](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/111.html \"View Case\") the Tribunal came to the conclusion that this allegation of sexual\nabuse was equivocal because subsequent investigations found that\nthe allegations\nof sexual abuse were \"*confirmed*\" and resulted in the payment of $25,000\non 5 April 2006 awarded by the Victims Compensation Tribunal which concluded\nthat the sexual\nassault did occur. Despite the serious nature of these\nallegations, little weight ultimately can be placed upon them because of the\ncontradictory findings by different investigatory agencies at various points in\ntime. The Administrative Decisions Tribunal had the\nbenefit of extensive oral\nevidence and a consideration of the matter which is not available in the hearing\nbefore this Tribunal.\nThe findings may also be sufficient to trigger an\nassessment because of clause 2(a) of Schedule 1 of the Act, but because of the\nconvictions already recited, the triggered assessment was validly commenced. No\nweight was placed upon these allegations in the determination\nof the interim\napplication for a stay. The position in relation to this allegation remains the\nsame on the final hearing of this\nmatter as referred to in the interim decision.\nThat is, no weight can be placed upon the equivocal nature of the findings\nrelating\nto the sexual abuse allegations.\n\n\n1. The\nTribunal finds that the convictions of the applicant were for serious offences\ninvolving violence. Additionally, the victims of\nthat violence are all female\nand one of whom was a former foster child over the age of 18 at the time of the\noffence.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant accepted that the offence in relation to the assault of the former\nfoster child is a serious offence. Indeed all of\nthe convictions are for serious\noffences of violence involving females and mainly perpetrated in the presence of\nchildren.\n\n\n**The period of time since those offences or matters occurred and the\nconduct of the person since they occurred**\n\n\n\n1. The\nperiod of time since the offences and matters occurred vary. The earliest\nrecorded matter occurred in 2003. The latest offence\noccurred in 2008 and the\napplicant was convicted in 2009. Therefore the latest conviction occurred nearly\n5 years ago.\n\n\n**The age of the person at the time the offences or matters occurred**\n\n\n\n1. At\nthe time of the offences and matters referred to the applicant was aged 36\nthrough to 42 years of age.\n\n\n**The age of each victim of any relevant offence or conduct at the time they\noccurred and any matters relating to the vulnerability\nof the victim**\n\n\n\n1. The\nages of the victims varied. The only alleged child victim is in relation to the\nallegations concerning the 14-year-old former\nfoster child, who is alleged to\nhave been sexually abused by the applicant. That alleged victim suffers from\nfrontal lobe brain damage\nand had reportedly been sexually abused by her father\nprior to coming into care of the Minister. No weight can be placed upon this\nalleged conduct for the purposes of these proceedings.\n\n\n1. The\nvictims of the applicant's offences for which he has received punishment through\nthe criminal law have all been adult females\nwith whom he has had a personal or\ndomestic relationship and in the case of his wife, with whom he continues to\nhave a relationship.\n\n\n1. The\nvictim of one of the offences was the applicant's former foster daughter then\naged 18, who was a vulnerable woman. It was conceded\nby the applicant that this\nis highly inappropriate behaviour. The Tribunal views this particular offence\nwith great concern. During\nthe course of the offence of violence there were\nwitnesses who were vulnerable children. The applicant did not moderate his\nbehaviour\ndespite the presence of those children. The children who were\nwitnesses to those offences are vulnerable, particularly the children\nwho were\ndance students of the former foster daughter who was 18 at the time of the\noffence for which the applicant was convicted\nin 2009.\n\n\n1. The\nfoster children who were present at the time of the domestic violence offence\ncommitted by the applicant against his wife are\nvulnerable children due to their\nhistory and because they are children. According to Dr Lennings' report the\nbrief history of the\nchildren's experience in their family of origin is that\nthey were physically and sexually abused, that their father had both psychosis\nand organic brain damage and the mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The\nfoster child who is now under the age of 18 and currently\nliving with the\napplicant's wife has been diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder. These\nchildren are highly likely to be adversely\naffected by additional incidents of\nviolence to those which they had already experienced in their family of origin,\nand the cumulative\neffect of experiencing further acts of violence is\nregrettable. Dr Lennings in his evidence extracted later in these reasons\nidentifies\nthe effect on these children of this offence.\n\n\n**The difference in age between the victim and the person and the\nrelationship (if any) between the victim and the person**\n\n\n\n1. The\napplicant was aged 41 of the time of the incident in 2008 and the victim was\naged 18. That is the largest age difference between\nthe applicant and the\nvictims of his offences. The greatest difference is therefore 23\nyears.\n\n\n1. The\nvictims of the applicant's offences have all been females with whom he has had a\npersonal or domestic relationship and in the\ncase of his wife, with whom he\ncontinues to have a relationship.\n\n\n1. The\nvictim of one of the offences was the applicant's former foster daughter. It was\nconceded by the applicant that this is highly\ninappropriate\nbehaviour.\n\n\n1. The\nincidents which occurred between the applicant and his wife were apparently\nwitnessed by the two male foster children in their\ncare. Those children were\nentitled to be protected from any violence.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant has been convicted of offences against his sister-in-law and her\nsister. Young children were present at the time of\nthose offences. The applicant\ndid not moderate his behaviour taking into account the relationship between him\nand the victims, and\ndisregarding the presence of children and the potentially\nsignificantly adverse effect of his behaviour upon them.\n\n\n1. The\ndifference in age is not a major factor in the applicant's offending behaviours.\nThe prominent distinguishing feature is that\nthe applicant does not regulate his\nbehaviours in the presence of females with whom he has had a personal\nrelationship. The applicant\nhas behaved inappropriately in the presence of young\nchildren by assaulting these women. The effect upon those young children of\nhis\nfrightening behaviour is clearly something which the applicant should have had\nregard to, when he committed those offences.\n\n\n**Whether the person knew, or could reasonably have known that the victim\nwas a child**\n\n\n\n1. The\nvictims were not children as defined in the Act: section 5 (1) of the\nAct.\n\n\n1. It\nis stated by Dr Lennings in his report dated 14 November 2008 at [75] that he\npointed out to the applicant that in Dr Lennings\nview the former foster daughter\nwho the applicant assaulted, although she was over the age of 18, was in Dr\nLennings' view the applicant's\nchild \"*irrespective of her age and that he\nneeded to exercise responsibility in this behaviour and attitude towards\nher.*\" Clearly, this view refers to the relationship which existed rather\nthan the age of the victim.\n\n\n**The person's present age.**\n\n\n\n1. The\napplicant is currently 47 years of age.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant may have matured and reflected upon his behaviours due to his further\nexperiences and consideration of the consequences\nof past\nexperiences.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant is now employed in an office environment where he works on special\nprojects. Previously he worked as a mechanic. The\napplicant clearly derives a\ngreat deal of satisfaction from his relationship with his foster children who\ncurrently reside with the\napplicant's wife. The applicant has found dealing with\nthese proceedings and the interim bar decision challenging and is now seeing\nhis\npsychiatrist approximately every six weeks instead of the previous interval of\nsix months. Maturity has not apparently reduced\nhis vulnerability to\nstress.\n\n\n**The seriousness of the person's total criminal record and the conduct of\nthe person since the offences occurred**\n\n\n\n1. The\napplicant has been sentenced in relation to serious offences of violence. They\nhave been partially explained by reference to the\nadverse reaction to stress,\nchange of medications and the applicant's mental health. The applicant has\nprovided references from friends\nwhich attest to his good character and his\nability to behave appropriately when he chooses to do so.\n\n\n1. There\nhas been no criminal offence committed by the applicant since\n2009.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant relies upon his completion of courses in 2009 one of which is called\n\"*Enough is Enough*\" which addressed stress and anger management. This\ncourse was completed on 26 August 2009. The applicant has also completed a\ncourse\non 17 August 2009 titled \"*Engaging Adolescents*\". The letter which\naccompanied the certificate from \"*Enough is Enough*\" was addressed to the\nGuardian ad litem for the children in the proceedings in the Administrative\nDecisions Tribunal, but only referred\nto 2 occasions of violence. This places\nsome doubt upon the level of disclosure given by the applicant when completing\nthat anger\nmanagement course. The applicant has not been reported to display\novert aggressive impulses or behaviour since 2009.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant's counsellor gave evidence but was unfortunately missing files. She\ncould not elaborate upon the material that has already\nbeen provided in\ndocumentary form. The applicant has attempted to address his anger management\nissues which have led to a number\nof his past difficulties.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant has not provided any evidence of completing a program of\nself-development concerning his assault of and attitudes towards\nwomen and\ndisplaying those violent attitudes and behaviours in the presence of children.\nThe Tribunal raised in the interim decision\nthe fact that the offences of\nviolence had a distinguishing element (at [78], [84], [88], and [137]), which\nfinding has been referred\nto again earlier in these reasons. A domestic violence\nprogram targeting perpetrators of domestic violence towards women, may have\nfurther assisted the applicant.\n\n\n**The likelihood of any repetition by the person of the offences or conduct\nand the impact on children of any such repetition**\n\n\n\n1. This\naspect was the subject of considerable volume of evidence and includes the\nexpert opinion provided by Dr Lennings.\n\n\n1. Dr\nLennings provided written reports dated 14 November 2008, 2 December 2008, and 1\nAugust 2014.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant submitted that Dr Lennings' assessment that the children in the care\nof the applicant and his wife are vulnerable children\nand are likely to suffer\nmore from the absence of the applicant then they are to suffer from any verbal\noutbursts: Report dated 14\nNovember 2008 at [113]. The incidents as described\nfrom the information earlier in these reasons were more than verbal outbursts.\nIt was also submitted that Dr Lennings' view was that the applicant does not\nrepresent an ongoing high-level risk to the children\nand the risk he does pose\ncan be managed by focused psychotherapy and various parenting programs which\nwere recommended by Dr Lennings:\nReport dated 14 November 2008 at\n[115].\n\n\n1. It\nwas submitted on behalf of the respondent that this Dr Lennings report states\nthat there is a \"*moderate further risk of harm to the children, primarily a\nfunction of [the applicant's] lack of insight into how his explosive behaviour\nand rigid obsessional behaviour can impact on the children's development should\nthey choose to defy him at some time.*\": Report dated 14 November 2008 at\n[112].\n\n\n1. The\nrespondent also submitted that there were concerns expressed by Dr Lennings\nabout the applicant's \"*explosive nature*\" and that his aggression is now\n\"*a pattern of such behaviour\":* Report dated 14 November 2008 at\n[106].\n\n\n1. Dr\nLennings performed an assessment and provided an additional report dated 1\nAugust 2014. For the purposes of that assessment Dr\nLennings interviewed the\napplicant and his wife on 29 July 2014. The foster child who resides with the\napplicant's wife accompanied\nthem to the interview but was not interviewed by Dr\nLennings.\n\n\n1. Dr\nLennings conducted an interview on this occasion lasting approximately an hour.\n\n\n1. It\nwould be fair to say that Dr Lennings' evidence in the Tribunal was consistent\nwith his report. Dr Lennings conducted a risk assessment\nutilising the Family\nStrengths and Needs measure. The applicant and his wife were included in that\nrisk assessment. Dr Lennings stated\nin his report that his current risk\nassessment using this item is largely consistent with his views in 2008: Report\ndated 1 August\n2014 at [37].\n\n\n1. Dr\nLennings also conducted an assessment of violent risk using an assessment tool\ndescribed as HCR-20. This device requires a response\nto 10 historical or static\nitems predictive of risk of violence: five items that assess clinical factors\nknown to be predictive of\nviolence and five items that reflect items important\nfor the management of violence risk. The items which were suggestive of some\nrisk for the applicant as recorded by Dr Lennings were the historical events\nwhich resulted in the criminal offences. It is asserted\nby Dr Lennings that the\napplicant's mental health contributes to his violence risk. It is asserted that\nthe original anger episodes\nwere associated with untreated and then a disruption\nin treatment of his depression: Report dated 1 August 2014 at [39], [41]. There\nwere identified also relationship issues with the female foster child which the\napplicant found challenging according to Dr Lennings.\n\n\n1. The\nrespondent was critical of Dr Lennings' assessment and submitted, for example\nthat his current opinion minimises the applicant's\nviolent behaviours in the\npast by calling them \"*intemperate behaviour*\". The respondent submitted\nthat Dr Lennings effectively ignored his previous report where he found a\npattern of violent behaviour,\npreferring now to call it only two episodes of\nviolent behaviour: Report 1 August 2014 at [41]. These observations appear\nreasonable\ncriticisms of the latest assessment by Dr Lennings. However, Dr\nLennings, as recorded earlier, believed his assessment was largely\nconsistent\nwith his views in 2008 and referred to previously in these\nreasons.\n\n\n1. It\nis clear that the offences which the applicant committed were seriously violent\nand scary events. A child witnessing those events\nwould not find them trifling\nand be scared by the violence to women.\n\n\n1. Dr\nLennings put forward a hypothesis in his most recent report that there are three\nprimary requirements likely for a further incident\nto occur. The first of those\nis that the applicant's psychological condition would need to deteriorate. This\nis clearly identifying\nthe supposition that the previous behaviour was caused by\na deterioration in the applicant's psychological condition. The second\nfactor is\nthat there would need to be the development of a history of conflict between the\napplicant and the foster son, and the\nthird factor would be that the applicant\nentered into a period of significant stress. Dr Lennings believes that scenario\nappears\nunlikely: Report 1 August 2014 at [46].\n\n\n1. Dr\nLennings recommended that the most important management need for the applicant\nis continuing access to treatment for depression\nincluding pharmacological\nmanagement.\n\n\n1. There\nis, however, evidence before the Tribunal that in 2008 the applicant assaulted\nhis foster daughter at the beginning of September\n2008 and then was admitted to\na psychiatric hospital for treatment of his major depression. It was said by the\npsychiatrist who was\ntreating him at the time recorded in a letter dated 30\nSeptember 2008:\n\n\n\"Despite his depressive condition and his physical impairment, [the\napplicant] has engaged well in the hospital day programs and with\nother staff,\nand presents as a person with insight into his anger issues and is determined to\nundertake meaningful therapy. There\nhas been no behaviour on the ward that could\nbe remotely construed as aggressive.... continued estrangement from his foster\nsons\nwill be instrumental in perpetuating [the applicant's] depressive condition\nand will be likely to significantly retard his recovery.\n[The applicant] would\nnot appear to be a risk of physical aggression in any but the most extreme\ncircumstances of provocation, and\nI would advocate a repeal of the separation\norder at the earliest possible juncture.\"\n\n\n\n1. Despite\nthat expert opinion, when he was discharged from the hospital on 8 October 2008\nhe committed the violent and scary offences\nagainst his wife in the presence of\nhis foster children which have been referred to previously in these reasons, and\nthen he was\nreadmitted to hospital. This was not \"*the most extreme\ncircumstances of provocation*\" but a violent and unwarranted incident. The\napplicant told his psychiatrist (recorded in Dr Pusic's report of 23 March\n2009), he\nadmitted he was verbally abusive towards his wife but said he at no\nstage had any intent to physically harm her. The impulsive behaviour\nwas\nunacceptable by any standard and the applicant was punished for the breach of\nthose standards. The report by the applicant about\ndifficulty with the\nmedication is not apparent from the letter dated 30 September 2008 by his\ntreating psychiatrist at the hospital.\nIt is clear from the letter that if the\napplicant did not get what he wanted, a repeal of the separation order, his\ntreatment would\nbe retarded. The expert opinion did not predict the following\nevents based upon the treatment of the applicant.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant clearly had and continues to have a need for psychiatric treatment\nwith which he is currently compliant.\n\n\n1. In\nhis report dated 14 November 2008 Dr Lennings stated at [79], referring to the\nsame 8 October 2008 violent incident with his wife\nwith the children\npresent:\n\n\n\"I pointed out to [the applicant] the concerns that such behaviour if\nrepeated could cause ongoing problems in terms of anxiety or\ndistress to his\nchildren. [The applicant] defended that by saying he loved his children and he\nwould not hurt his children and he\ncould not imagine a situation occurring where\nhis children would be defiant say in the form that [the former foster child the\napplicant\nassaulted] had been. However, such a comment places some\nresponsibility on the children for not developing defiance in their behaviour\ntowards their father. [The applicant] appeared to be unable to internalise\nthe necessity for him to exercise responsibility for his behaviour and\ncontinuing to externalise the controls\nfor his behaviour into the\nenvironment. The difficulty for [the applicant] is that a combination of\ndepression plus a tense environment is likely to lead to him acting\nin an\nimpulsive and potentially aggressive way given the pattern that has occurred\nover at least three occasions of such behaviour\nbeing evidenced. Whilst I\nbelieve such lapses would be rare, the impact of such lapses could potentially\nbe quite catastrophic.\"\n(Emphasis added)\n\n\n\n1. Dr\nPusic gave evidence by telephone and was generally supportive of the applicant.\nIt was clear that he did not know the full details\nof all the events which have\noccurred in the applicant's life. Dr Pusic is concerned to treat the applicant\nwith medication and psychotherapy\nto the best of his ability. That requires\nconstant monitoring to ensure the medication is effective and at the right dose.\nChanges\nmay need to be made to the treatment regime as circumstances change\naccording to the tenor of Dr Pusic's evidence.\n\n\n1. Dr\nTait also gave evidence by telephone. The evidence he gave was supportive of the\napplicant and he considered that the applicant's\n'exile' from his home by a\ngovernment agency was pointless and damaging to the family.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant's wife gave evidence and was a witness of truth. It was clear that she\nsaw her primary responsibility is to care for\nthe children and protect them from\nany risks of being exposed to domestic violence. Unfortunately, she was not able\nto do that in\nthe past due to the applicant's behaviour.\n\n\n1. It\nwas determined that the information provided to the Tribunal for the interim\ndecision about the stay application in this matter\nidentified that the applicant\nposed a risk to children. That risk must be \"*a real and appreciable\nrisk*\": see *BYR v Children's Guardian* [[2013] NSWADT 310](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2013/310.html \"View Case\"), at [38],\n[39]; *AYU v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian* [[2014] NSWCATAD 69](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCATAD/2014/69.html \"View Case\"), at\n[37], [38]; *Commission for Children and Young People v V* [[2002] NSWSC\n949](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/949.html \"View Case\"); [56 NSWLR 476](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=56%20NSWLR%20476 \"View LawCiteRecord\"), at [42] per Young CJ in Eq (as he then was). The evidence\nsubsequently received does not displace that conclusion. The evidence\nidentifies\nthat the applicant does pose such a risk to children.\n\n\n1. The\nparamount consideration set out in section 4 of the Act refers in particular to\nprotecting children from \"*child abuse*\".\n\n\n1. There\nis no relevant definition of \"*child abuse*\" contained within the\nAct.\n\n\n1. In\nthe reasons provided in the interim proceedings for a stay, the Tribunal\nreferred to definitions of \"*child abuse*\" which may be useful in\nconsidering the definition of that term as used in the Act. In written\nsubmissions by the respondent at the\nfinal hearing, it was submitted that the\ndefinitions referred to in those interim hearing reasons commencing at [102] are\nappropriate\ndefinitions to consider in reviews under the Act.\n\n\n1. As\nthe Tribunal observed in the interim decision the Act is part of a suite of\nlegislation designed to protect children. The Children's\nGuardian who is\nresponsible for the oversight of the Act is appointed under [section 178](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caypapa1998442/s178.html) of the\n*[Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caypapa1998442/)* (NSW). There is\nan offence created in [section 227](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caypapa1998442/s227.html) of the *[Children and Young Persons (Care and\nProtection) Act 1998](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caypapa1998442/)* (NSW) which is as follows:\n\n\n\"Child and young person abuse\n\n\n\nA person who intentionally takes action that has resulted in or appears\nlikely to result in:\n\n\n\n(a) the physical injury or sexual abuse of a child or young person, or\n\n\n\n(b) a child or young person suffering emotional or psychological harm of such\na kind that the emotional or intellectual development\nof the child or young\nperson is, or is likely to be, significantly damaged, or\n\n\n\n(c) the physical development or health of the child or young person being\nsignificantly harmed,\n\n\n\nis guilty of an offence.\n\n\n\nMaximum penalty: 200 penalty units\"\n\n\n\n1. The\ndefinition of \"*abuse*\" in [section 4](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s4.html) (1) of the *[Family Law Act 1975](/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/)*\n(Cth) is similar.\n\n\n1. For\nthe purposes of these proceedings, it is sufficient to observe that the evidence\nestablishes that there is a real and appreciable\nrisk of harm to children if the\napplicant repeats his unacceptable behaviour in the presence of children or if\nit is directed to\nchildren. That risk of harm may also constitute child abuse as\nit is defined in the relevant legislation.\n\n\n1. The\njurisdiction of the Tribunal under the Act is protective, not punitive, and an\nassessment of risk should err on the side of caution\nwhilst balancing all of the\nrisks which may be posed to children. Those risks include considerations of the\nimpact of the behaviour\nof the applicant on particular children, and the\npredicted consequences of a repetition of that behaviour on children, according\nto Dr Lennings as \"*potentially...quite catastrophic*\". The paramount\nprinciple under the Act requires that the protection of children, particularly\nfrom child abuse, is the main focus\nbut it is not the only factor which must be\nconsidered.\n\n\n**Any information given by the applicant in, or in relation to, the\napplication**\n\n\n\n1. It\nhas previously been observed in the interim decision that the applicant was\nreluctant to engage with the Office of the Children's\nGuardian stating to the\nwoman at that office on 21 March 2014 that he will not provide any more\ninformation for the risk assessment\nbeing conducted at that time, in order to\nprogress a decision bar outcome so he may then appeal that outcome to the\nTribunal and\nthen to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant was given an opportunity to submit further supporting material to\nassist in his risk assessment, when he was advised\nthat there was a proposed\nrefusal of his application on or about 22 April 2014. This information is\nrecorded in a letter dated 2\nJune 2014 from the Office of the Children's\nGuardian. The information which was sought was information which could mitigate\nany of\nthe identified risks. No further material was supplied in response to\nthat request.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant has an obligation to fully disclose to the Tribunal any matters\nrelevant to the application: section 27 (4) of the Act.\n\n\n1. Since\nthat time the applicant filed a bundle of documents received by the Tribunal on\n2 July 2014 and the other evidence referred\nto previously in these reasons. This\ninformation was helpful to the Tribunal in reaching its final\ndecision.\n\n\n1. However,\nthe reluctance of the applicant to engage in the disclosure process with the\nChildren's Guardian appears a continuation of\nthe failure to internalise the\nnecessity for him to exercise responsibility for his behaviour and continuing to\nexternalise the controls\nfor his behaviour into the environment identified by Dr\nLennings. It is perhaps merely a coincidence that the witness for the Children's\nGuardian who was cross-examined and conducted the risk assessment is also a\nyoung woman.\n\n\n**Any other matters that the Children's Guardian considers necessary**\n\n\n\n1. The\nChildren's Guardian also considered the professional references provided by Dr\nTait and Dr Pusic. It was considered at that time\nthat both references appeared\nminimal in addressing the risks posed by the history of the applicant and the\nauthors of those documents\ndid not return the calls from the Office of the\nChildren's Guardian to permit the references to be verified. Both doctors\nhowever\ngave evidence to the Tribunal.\n\n\n1. Dr\nPusic, the applicant's treating psychiatrist, provided a report dated 26 June\n2014 subsequent to the assessment by the Children's\nGuardian. In that report the\npsychiatrist states that he has seen the applicant on six occasions over the\nlast 18 months and last\nsaw him on 19 June 2014. According to the report the\napplicant maintains pharmacotherapy on antidepressant and mood stabiliser\nmedication\nand has received cognitive behavioural psychotherapy. Dr Pusic stated\nthat the applicant \"*has recently been placed under considerable stress by the\nOffice of the Children's Guardianship's (sic) decision that he not reside\nwith\nhis fostered children. This is despite the fact that the two children concerned\nhave been under the care of [the applicant's]\nwife and himself for 15 years...\nHe has not displayed aggressive impulses or behaviour since his difficulties in\nearly March 2009.\nHis prognosis is excellent*.\"\n\n\n1. Dr\nPusic was cross-examined at the final hearing of this matter by telephone. The\napplicant has seen him recently to deal with the\nstress he is experiencing. The\nopinions Dr Pusic previously expressed remain the same as those in his written\nmaterial.\n\n\n1. The\nstress currently experienced by the applicant, as recorded in the extract from\nDr Pusic's report, is apparently attributed to\nthe decision to issue an interim\nbar and at the time of the report the final decision had also been\nmade.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant was clearly displeased with the investigation and assessment process\nundertaken by the Children's Guardian and wanted\nto progress the decision to be\nmade so he could exercise his rights of review and appeal.\n\n\n**Determination**\n\n\n\n1. The\napplicant accepted that the offence in relation to the former foster daughter is\na serious offence. There are other offences which\nare also very serious and\nconcerning. The impact of those offences upon the safety of children should be\nobvious, and the applicant\nis very fortunate that nothing more serious\neventuated from any of those incidents where children could have been subjected\nto life-threatening\ninjuries. As it is, the children who were present at the\ntimes of those offences have been exposed to behaviour which may constitute\nchild abuse.\n\n\n1. The\nvictims of the applicant's offences of assault have all been females with whom\nhe has had a personal or domestic relationship\nand in the case of his wife, with\nwhom he continues to have a relationship. There is a pattern of offending\nbehaviour.\n\n\n1. The\nfoster children present at the time of the domestic violence offences committed\nby the applicant against his wife are vulnerable\nchildren.\n\n\n1. The\napplicant determined that he would not provide any additional information to the\nChildren's Guardian to assist further with the\nassessment of risk despite it\nbeing in his interests and arguably also his obligation to do so. There has now\nbeen further information\nprovided to the Tribunal.\n\n\n1. If\nthe applicant is granted a clearance he may work with any children of any age.\nNo conditions may be imposed upon the grant of a\nclearance. It is unfortunate\nthat the foster child currently in the care of the applicant's wife is dependent\nand attached to the\napplicant and the failure to obtain a clearance will have an\neffect upon that child as well as the applicant. That foster child also\nhas to\ncounteract the negative effect on him of incidents of domestic violence\nperpetrated by the applicant in his presence. That\nchild and the other foster\nson (no longer a child) could have been seriously injured in the incident of\ndomestic violence perpetrated\nby the applicant where he drove dangerously and\nthen violently pulled the window out of the driver's side door of the car so\nthat\nthere was broken glass.\n\n\n1. For\nthe purposes of these proceedings, it is sufficient to observe that the evidence\nestablishes that there is a real and appreciable\nrisk of harm to children if the\napplicant repeats his unacceptable behaviour in the presence of children or if\nit is directed to\nchildren. The behaviours in the past occurred with women who\nwere in the presence of children and that did not cause the applicant\nto modify\nhis violent behaviour. That risk of harm may also constitute child abuse as it\nis defined in the relevant legislation.\n\n\n1. The\nevidence received by the Tribunal establishes that the Tribunal cannot be\nsatisfied that the applicant does not pose a risk to\nchildren. The safety,\nwelfare and well-being of children and in particular protecting them from child\nabuse is the paramount consideration\npursuant to section 4 of the\nAct.\n\n\n1. In\nall the circumstances, on the balance of probabilities and taking into account\nall the considerations required under section 30\n(1) of the Act the correct and\npreferable decision having regard to the material before the Tribunal is that\nthe applicant poses\na risk to the safety of children and should not receive a\nWorking with Children check clearance.\n\n\n1. The\norder of the Tribunal therefore is:\n\n\n\n> \n> (1) The decision of the Children's Guardian dated 2 June 2014 to refuse to grant\n> the applicant a Working with Children check clearance\n> is\n> affirmed.\n\n\n\n> \n> (2) The application for review of the decision of the Children's Guardian filed\n> 4 June 2014 is otherwise refused and dismissed.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
